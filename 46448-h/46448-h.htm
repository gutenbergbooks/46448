<h2 class="p4">Foreword</h2>

<p class="pn2">With the unprecedented increase in our commercial
activities has come a demand for better business
methods. Methods which were adequate for the
business of a less active commercial era, have given way to
systems and labor-saving ideas in keeping with the financial
and industrial progress of the world.</p>

<p>Out of this progress has risen a new literature&mdash;the
literature of business. But with the rapid advancement in
the science of business, its literature can scarcely be said to
have kept pace, at least, not to the same extent as in other
sciences and professions. Much excellent material dealing
with special phases of business activity has been prepared,
but this is so scattered that the student desiring to acquire
a comprehensive business library has found himself confronted
by serious difficulties. He has been obliged, to a great extent,
to make his selections blindly, resulting in many duplications
of material without securing needed information on important
phases of the subject.</p>

<p>In the belief that a demand exists for a library which
shall embrace the best practice in all branches of business&mdash;from
buying to selling, from simple bookkeeping to the
administration of the financial affairs of a great corporation&mdash;these
volumes have been prepared. Prepared primarily for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
use as instruction books for the American School of Correspondence,
the material from which the Cyclopedia has been
compiled embraces the latest ideas with explanations of the
most approved methods of modern business.</p>

<p>Editors and writers have been selected because of their
familiarity with, and experience in handling various subjects
pertaining to Commerce, Accountancy, and Business Administration.
Writers with practical business experience have
received preference over those with theoretical training;
practicability has been considered of greater importance than
literary excellence.</p>

<p>In addition to covering the entire general field of business,
this Cyclopedia contains much specialized information not
heretofore published in any form. This specialization is particularly
apparent in those sections which treat of accounting
and methods of management for Department Stores, Contractors,
Publishers and Printers, Insurance, and Real Estate.
The value of this information will be recognized by every
student of business.</p>

<p>The principal value which is claimed for this Cyclopedia
is as a reference work, but, comprising as it does the material
used by the School in its correspondence courses, it is offered
with the confident expectation that it will prove of great
value to the trained man who desires to become conversant
with phases of business practice with which he is unfamiliar,
and to those holding advanced clerical and managerial
positions.</p>

<p>In conclusion, grateful acknowledgment is made to authors
and collaborators, to whose hearty coöperation the excellence
of this work is due.</p>

<h2 class="p4">PURCHASING AND STORES DEPARTMENT</h2>

<hr class="dec1" />

<h3 class="p2">PURCHASING DEPARTMENT</h3>

<p><b>1.</b> If the old axiom, "Goods well bought are half sold," holds
true, the purchasing department may well be considered one of the
most important in any business. In referring to the purchasing
department we have in mind that department, or division of the business,
whose duty it is to attend to the buying. In a large industrial
enterprise this may mean a department headed by a purchasing
agent with several assistants; in a department store, the buyers for
the several departments; in a small retail business, the member of the
firm who buys the goods. No matter whether the department be an
extensive one, or one requiring but a part of the time of one man, the
principle is the same.</p>

<p>Perhaps no other head of a department has greater need of complete
information and systematic records of his department, than
does the buyer. A man may have every qualification for a successful
purchasing agent, but, unless he has the most detailed information to
aid him in judging qualities and prices, his cannot be considered a
successful department. On the other hand, many a man, with no
other qualification than common sense, has built up a most successful
purchasing department because his work was thoroughly systematized.</p>

<p>We will consider the purchasing department from two standpoints:
The <i>information required</i>, and the <i>routine work</i> to be performed.
Under the first head the requirements may be stated as:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">1. List of dealers.</p>

<p class="pbq">2. Full information about lines carried by each dealer or manufacturer.</p>

<p class="pbq">3. Records of special quotations.</p>

<p class="pbq">4. Information about qualities supplied by various dealers, to be obtained
from records of past purchases.</p>

<h3 class="p2">LIST OF DEALERS</h3>

<p><b>2.</b> The purchasing agent will have no difficulty in securing a
list of dealers. Even a new business is usually well supplied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
circulars, catalogues, and other information showing which dealers
handle certain lines. The principal concern of the purchasing agent
is to so record this information that it will be instantly available.</p>

<p>In some cases it is found necessary to make special lists of dealers,
and these are usually made on cards. A card is used for each article
or class of material that may be of interest, and the name of the class
is written at the top of the card. Below this are listed the names and
addresses of dealers and manufacturers supplying that particular
class of material. Since in most concerns this information can be
combined with the system of catalogue indexing, we do not show a
special form for this record.</p>

<h3 class="p2">CATALOGUE FILING AND INDEXING</h3>

<p><b>3.</b> A purchasing agent must necessarily gather much of the
information required in the operation of his department from catalogues
supplied by manufacturers. These catalogues are his technical
library, in many cases supplying the only available information
relative to a particular class of goods. Needless to say, some method
must be provided for carefully preserving these catalogues. They
must be filed in such a manner that they can be located quickly.</p>

<p>While every office has plenty of opportunities to accumulate an
oversupply of catalogues, resulting in a tendency to discard all except
those in which the purchasing agent may be interested at the
time, it is better to err on the side of a liberal supply. A catalogue
that comes in to-day may be of no immediate value, but it may become
useful a little later. It would be impracticable to keep every catalogue
and circular that reaches the office, but, if it is from a new concern,
or offers any new ideas, it should be kept, even though the subject
is not of especial interest at the moment.</p>

<p>Many systems of catalogue filing have been devised, and there
are almost as many styles of catalogue files on the market as there are
manufacturers of such equipment. No one system or style of filing
will answer the requirements in every concern. Each must build up
a filing system that will conform to existing conditions.</p>

<p>Though a system of universal application cannot be laid down,
some general suggestions may prove of value. No matter what the
style of receptacle used, catalogues are filed according to one of two
methods: The <i>alphabetical</i>, or the <i>numerical</i>. The alphabetical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
method consists in the arrangement of catalogues in bookcases or
other suitable devices, according to the names of the publishers.
For a small number of catalogues, this is a very satisfactory system,
for the very reason that a purchasing agent soon becomes familiar
with the catalogues of different manufacturers, recognizing them by
their size, shape, or color.</p>

<p>A modification of the alphabetical system is one in which the
catalogues are arranged alphabetically by classes; that is, the lines of
goods in which the purchasing agent is interested are divided into
specific classes. In each of these divisions, the catalogues of all manufacturers
listing that class of goods are arranged in alphabetical order.
This method is also very satisfactory for a limited number of catalogues.</p>

<p>For a large catalogue file the numerical system will prove the
most satisfactory. By this system each catalogue is given a number
which should be plainly shown on the back of the catalogue. All
catalogues of a specific class are placed in one group, and a series of
numbers is set aside for the group. To illustrate, we might have
machinery catalogues, numbers 1 to 100. All machinery catalogues
would then be given a number in that series. If the number be
increased beyond 100, the numbering system would be repeated
by using 1<i>a</i>, 2<i>a</i>, etc.</p>

<p>With the numerical system, the catalogues of each group must
be arranged in exact numerical order, so that any catalogue may be
instantly located.</p>

<p><b>4. Files.</b> As has already been stated, the style of file, as well
as the method of filing, or indexing, must conform to the conditions
in each individual office. However, the experience of the past is the
best guide for the future. As a general rule, sectional bookcases will
be found the most satisfactory for catalogues in bound form, that is,
those with substantial covers, and particularly those that will readily
stand on edge. An advantage of the sectional bookcase is that all
catalogues can plainly be seen, and even though a numerical system
be used, a man soon learns to recognize catalogues of certain manufacturers
without referring to any number or indexing system.</p>

<p>In every catalogue file will be found pamphlets, circulars, and
price lists which are not easily cared for in bookcases. For these a
section of a vertical file is recommended, and in many cases this file<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
has been used successfully for filing all sorts of miscellaneous catalogues.
It may be expanded to any capacity, and can be used with
equal success for either the alphabetical or numerical system of indexing.</p>

<p>Which is the better depends upon the circumstances, but in
nearly every case either the sectional bookcase or the vertical file, or
perhaps a combination of the two, will be found most satisfactory.</p>

<p><b>5. Catalogue Indexing.</b> The principal value of a file of catalogues
lies in the index. A miscellaneous lot of catalogues is of very
little value unless it be properly indexed. True, most catalogues contain
an index, but this is not the sort of index required by the purchasing
agent. He does not care for an itemized list of every article
manufactured by John Jones &amp; Co., but he does want an index that
will show him where he can find descriptions and prices of machines
of a certain class. A catalogue may list thousands of articles in
which the purchasing agent has no interest, where it lists ten that are
of use to him. These ten articles are the ones which should be
shown in his index.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 1. Subject Card for Catalogue Index</p>
</div></div>

<p>The principal index of the catalogue file is one arranged by
subjects. A card used for this purpose is shown in Fig. 1. At the
top of the card is listed the subject. Below this is given the names
and addresses of all manufacturers supplying the goods listed.
In the columns at the right are recorded the section number,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
catalogue number, and page. The section number refers to the
section in the file where the catalogue will be found; the catalogue
number to the catalogue itself; and the page to the number of the
page in the catalogue. In making up such an index, it is unnecessary
to include a long list of articles of no especial interest, but simply
those which the concern is obliged to purchase. If an entirely new
subject comes up, it can then be listed after suitable investigation.</p>

<p>These cards are filed alphabetically, according to the name of
the subject. While in some large concerns a more elaborate file
will be necessary, this index can usually be kept in a small card tray
in a desk drawer.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-020.jpg" width="400" height="250"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 2. Title Card for Catalogue Index</p>
</div></div>

<p>When the numerical system of filing is used, another index is
necessary to locate the catalogues by name. In most cases our chief
concern would be to locate the catalogue by subject, but there are
times when it becomes necessary to locate a catalogue by name.
To provide for this cross-index, the card shown in Fig. 2 is used. It
will be noted that the arrangement of this card is just the opposite of
the subject index, the name and address of the manufacturer being
given at the top of the card together with the reference to the section and
catalogue numbers. On the lower half of the card are listed the
names of articles, made by that manufacturer, in which we are interested.
This card is also filed alphabetically, but, of course, under
the name of the manufacturer. When the number of cards is limited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
both forms can be filed in the same index by using contrasting colors.
For instance, a buff color might be used for the subject index, and
salmon for the name index.</p>

<h3 class="p2">SPECIAL QUOTATIONS</h3>

<p><b>6.</b> Every purchasing agent receives, in addition to published
price lists, many special quotations on material and supplies in which
he is interested. Very frequently quotations are received at a time
when he is not in the market for the particular material offered, but
they are nevertheless of value for possible future use, and should be
carefully preserved.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-021.jpg" width="400" height="303"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 3. Card Form for Special Quotations</p>
</div></div>

<p>One method of handling special quotations is to set aside a special
file, or a drawer, or a section of the regular file, to be used exclusively
for quotations. The quotations, when such a file is used, are usually
filed alphabetically according to the name of the material offered.
This method of filing necessitates a cross-index to locate the letters
by names of firms and is not entirely satisfactory, owing to the difficulty
of locating the most advantageous quotations. There may be
a dozen or more letters from different firms quoting prices on the same
material, and, to find which is the lowest, all must be examined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Again, a firm will make quotations on several lines in the same letter,
which necessitates copying a part of the items or reorganizing the
filing system.</p>

<p>In a business receiving many such quotations, it is advisable to
reserve a special file for them, but we recommend their being filed
according to the names of firms. To provide an accessible record of
special quotations, the use of a special form, either on cards or loose
leaves, is recommended. While no form universally applicable can
be devised, the several forms herein presented are very good examples
of forms in use and offer some valuable points for study.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 is a conventional form. This is a card, at the top of which
is provided space for recording the name of the article or class of
material. Below this is a record of all quotations received, giving
date, name of the firm from whom the quotation is received, and
initials of the salesman making the quotation, when made in this
manner. The columns following are for quantity, or size on which
the quotation is based, the list price, discount, net, whether f. o. b. or
delivered, and terms. The last two columns are for a record of
orders placed.</p>

<p>One of these cards is used for each article or class of material
on which special quotations are received. Every quotation is recorded,
no matter from whom, and when the card is filled a new one
is added. Whenever records on any one card become obsolete, the
card can be destroyed, keeping the file up to date.</p>

<p>The cards are filed according to the names of the articles or
classes of material. When the number of classes is limited, it will
be satisfactory to index the cards by means of a straight alphabetical
index. In this case quotations on bolts and all other articles, the
names of which commence with <i>b</i>, would be filed back of the <i>B</i> index.
If the number of articles is large, it is advisable to use blank index
guides and write the names of classes of material. As an illustration,
in some lines of manufacture, bolts will be used in all sizes. On the
index would be written the word <i>Bolts</i>, and back of this the cards
would be filed according to sizes, one card being used for each size
of bolt. The same plan can be carried out for each class of material.
It is also advisable, in a manufacturing business, to subdivide the
file as, between materials&mdash;representing materials which actually
enter into the construction of the product manufactured&mdash;and supplies&mdash;representing
all classes of factory supplies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>A card especially designed for a record of quotations on articles
which are listed in several sizes is shown in Fig. 4. The special
feature of this form is the inclusion of several columns in which to
record prices on a number of different sizes of the same article. This
form would be especially applicable in recording prices on such
articles as bolts, mentioned in the preceding paragraph.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 4. Quotation Card for Records of Prices of Several Sizes</p>
</div></div>

<h3 class="p2">ORDERS PLACED</h3>

<p><b>7.</b> Of equal importance is a record of orders placed. A purchasing
agent needs to know where orders for a given article have
been placed in the past, prices paid, promptness of delivery, and
general character of goods received. A convenient method of recording
this information is to use a card similar to the illustration, Fig. 5,
which shows a form used for recording purchases of a given article
between specified dates. The record itself shows the order number,
quantity, name of vendor, and full information about prices, including
total cost per unit. These cards are filed alphabetically,
according to the name of the article, exactly as described for the records
of special quotations.</p>

<p>Fig. 6 omits some of the details, but provides for notations relative
to quantities, etc., under the heading, <i>description</i>. This form
also shows total amount, thus furnishing a record of the gross investment
in material of a given class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 7 is used in a manufacturing business, and is intended to
provide a record of orders placed which will prevent a duplication of
orders. At the extreme right of this form is a column headed <i>purpose</i>.
In many manufacturing businesses, orders for certain materials are
placed after contracts have been received, and the material is specified
for use on a certain contract or order. In other establishments several
lines of goods are manufactured, but certain materials enter into the
manufacture of all lines. The purchasing agent may receive requisitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
from different sources for material required in these various
lines, and his records should show for what lines or departments
orders have been placed. Both of these contingencies are provided
for in this form, as the purpose of each order is plainly stated.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 8. Record of Orders Providing for Details of Each Order</p>
</div></div>

<p>Fig. 8 is another special form, designed for use where certain
particulars are required. In devising a form, it should be made as
simple as possible, but, at the same time, provision should be made for
recording all particulars that may be of especial value in the business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in which it is to be used. The forms shown are presented, not as
being ideal for use in all cases, but for their suggestive value.</p>

<p>It is immaterial whether these forms be on cards or in loose-leaf
form. That is a question of individual preference, and can only be
decided by the person who is to make use of the system.</p>

<p>A good example of a form designed especially for use in a loose-leaf
system is shown in Fig. 9. This gives full information about both
orders and receipts, furnishing complete information relative to
quantities of any particular line handled.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 9. A Loose-Leaf Record of Goods Ordered and Received</p>
</div></div>

<p>The manner of filing is the same as with the card system, except
that these sheets are arranged between suitable indexes in a loose-leaf
binder. If desired, the order records and special quotations can be
filed together. By using forms of different colors the two can be filed
in the same index. This is a very convenient arrangement, for then
all records of both quotations and orders are found together. In
some cases all of the information required will be found on the order
records. When special quotations are received they can be filed in
front of, or immediately back of, this record.</p>

<p>While in some offices other special records may be advisable,
all necessary information for the average office relative to sources of
supply, prices, etc., are provided by catalogues and records of quotations
and prices described. Any other information required can be
provided for by a modification of the forms referred to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p2">DEPARTMENT ROUTINE</h3>

<p><b>8.</b> Any discussion of the routine duties of the purchasing department
is necessarily more or less theoretical and any method of
procedure laid down is subject to such modification as will reduce it
to a practical working basis for the individual establishment. To
present the subject in a practical manner, therefore, this discussion
will be confined to the needs of an average manufacturing business.
As has been stated elsewhere in these papers, it is much less difficult
to modify a system designed to care for all details in a large establishment
than to expand the simple systems of a small business.</p>

<p>The duties of the purchasing agent in respect to the actual purchase
of goods may be classified as follows:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">1. Receiving <i>requisitions</i>, or orders for materials and supplies required
for stock or in different departments.</p>

<p class="pbq">2. Placing and following up orders.</p>

<p class="pbq">3. Checking receipt of goods.</p>

<p class="pbq">4. Checking invoices for prices.</p>

<p class="pbq">5. Filing order copies and requisitions.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>9. Requisitions.</b> Under ordinary circumstances the purchasing
agent will place no orders until he has first received a requisition from
either the stores department or the department that requires the
material. The requisition should in every case state the purpose for
which the material or supplies is required, as well as by whom wanted.</p>

<p>Each department should be supplied with its own requisition
blanks, and, to make them distinctive, a different color should be
adopted for each department. Each department should also be
identified by a letter which will be printed on the requisition blank
in connection with a serial number. Thus the requisition numbers
of one department will start with <i>A</i>1, another <i>B</i>1, etc.</p>

<p>A positive rule should be laid down that all requisitions issued
by one department are to be signed by one person, usually the foreman.
This rule must be rigidly enforced and no requisitions honored
without the proper signature.</p>

<p>While requisitions should be drafted in a form to meet individual
requirements, Fig. 10 is given as a typical example that will be
found suitable in a large majority of offices.</p>

<p>The requisition, as a rule, is made in duplicate. The original
goes to the purchasing agent and the duplicate is retained by the
foreman. In some of the larger establishments a triplicate form is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
used, the original and duplicate being sent to the purchasing agent.
The duplicate is then returned to the foreman with proper notations
to show that the order has been placed.</p>

<p>There are very few cases, however, where this is necessary. It
is not a good plan to require the foreman to keep records that can be
eliminated, and the average foreman does not care when or where the
order is placed; all he wants is the material. He has no interest in
going back of the purchasing agent on whom he has made requisition.</p>

<p>When the factory is located at a distance from the office, requisitions
should be in triplicate and bear the O. K. of the superintendent
or factory manager. The duplicate will then be filed in the factory
office pending the receipt of the goods.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-028.jpg" width="400" height="309"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 10. A Typical Form of Requisition Blank</p>
</div></div>

<p>Foremen who make requisitions on the purchasing agent will
retain their copies until the material is received.</p>

<p>On receipt of the requisition, the purchasing agent first investigates
to find if the material, or some other that will answer the same
purpose, is in stock. If not, he looks up his sources of supply and
prices, and then he is ready to place the order. When a large investment
is involved, it is usually necessary to obtain special quotations,
and sometimes samples, before the order can be placed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p><b>10. Low Stock Report.</b> Another form of requisition is the low
stock report furnished by the stores clerk. Every article and class of
material in stock is given a <i>low</i> limit. When this limit is reached
the stores clerk makes a report, Fig. 11, to the purchasing agent.
This is recognized as a notice to purchase. The report shows the
low limit and quantity in stock. It is important that the low limit
be included, for in some cases it will be found advisable to change
the limit. Material formerly used in large quantities may now be in
so little demand that it will be thought best to reduce the limit. At
other times it will be necessary to increase the limit.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-029.jpg" width="400" height="308"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 11. The Stores Clerk's Report of Low Stock</p>
</div></div>

<p>The report is made in duplicate, a copy being retained by the
stores clerk until advised that the order has been placed. There is
no special need for keeping these reports permanently; all information
that they would supply may be had from copies of purchase orders.</p>

<p><b>11. Purchase Orders.</b> When an order is placed, it is of course
necessary to keep one or more copies. The best practice is to make
purchase orders in manifold, providing as many copies as may be
required. Modern typewriters and carbon paper render it possible
to make all necessary copies at one writing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The number of copies will be governed by the requirements of
the business. In a small business where the goods are received by
the purchasing agent, one copy is sufficient. When a receiving clerk
is employed, a second copy will be needed by him to check the receipt
of goods.</p>

<p>The illustration, Fig. 12, shows a set of six blanks, the original
and five copies, which will meet the requirements of the average
manufacturing business. These copies will be used as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-030.jpg" width="400" height="330"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 12. Typical Form of Manifold Order Blanks</p>
</div></div>

<p><i>Original.</i> This is to be mailed or delivered to the vendor.</p>

<p><i>Follow-Up Copy.</i> This copy is retained by the purchasing
agent to follow up the order. It is first filed in a tickler, or date file,
back of the date when an acknowledgment should be received. If
no acknowledgment is received, the vendor is followed up and the
order filed ahead.</p>

<p>The order is next filed under the date when the invoice should be
received. After the invoice is received, the order copy can be used
to follow up the transportation company for delivery.</p>

<p><i>Receiving Copy.</i> This copy goes to the receiving clerk who files<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
it according to the name of the vendor. When the goods are received,
he checks the items against the copy and returns it to the purchasing
agent. In some cases he reports the receipt of goods by means of a
receiving slip, which will be explained later.</p>

<p><i>Auditor's Copy.</i> In a highly organized business a copy of every
order is given to the comptroller or auditor. The principal use of
this copy is to furnish information in respect to obligations incurred,
that finances may be provided in advance.</p>

<p><i>Cost Department Copy.</i> The copy furnished the cost department
is to post the cost clerks in prices. In many large factories
complete files of all orders placed are kept in the cost office. This
is an excellent plan since it provides a complete price record.</p>

<p><i>Shop Copy.</i> This is intended for the special use of the factory
when located at a distance from the office. It is filed in the office of
the factory manager, under the name of the vendor, and supplies
him with a record of all orders placed for the factory.</p>

<p><b>12. Checking Receipts.</b> The purchasing agent will be advised
of the receipt of goods by the return of the receiving clerk's copy of
the order, properly checked. Or, in some cases, it may be advisable
to have all goods reported on a special form, Fig. 13.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>In those factories where a receiving clerk, as well as a stores clerk,
is employed, the receiving slip should be made in duplicate. One
copy will go to the stores clerk with the goods and will later be sent
to the purchasing agent, furnishing a double check on the goods.
The purchasing agent will send one copy to the cost clerk, first noting
the account to be charged. This gives the cost clerk the necessary
information for charging out material when used.</p>

<p>One argument in support of this plan is that, having no record
of quantities ordered, the receiving clerk will be compelled to carefully
count and list all articles received. But it is also true that he
is obliged to make a detailed copy instead of merely checking the
items against his copy of the order.</p>

<p>Another point in connection with the work of the receiving clerk
that has caused much discussion, is the wisdom of furnishing him with
a record of prices. The prevailing opinion among manufacturers
seems to be that this should not be done. This need not interfere
with the operation of our system, for prices can be left off the receiving
clerk's copy by using a short carbon. This will keep all
blanks uniform in size.</p>

<p><b>13. Checking Invoices.</b> It may be laid down as a rule that
invoices should first go to the purchasing agent, not for audit, but to
be checked for quantities and prices. The purchasing agent will
check the invoice, note on it the purpose, or the department for
which the goods were purchased, and forward it to the auditor. The
transaction is then closed so far as the purchasing agent is concerned.</p>

<p><b>14. Filing.</b> After the O. K.'d invoice has been forwarded to
the auditor, the following papers remaining in the purchasing department
are to be filed:</p>

<p><i>Follow-up copy of the order</i>, filed alphabetically under the name
of the vendor.</p>

<p><i>Receiving clerk's copy of the order</i>, filed with the original requisition.</p>

<p><i>Requisition from the department requesting the goods</i>, filed
numerically according to the departmental serial number; that is,
all requisitions from <i>Dept. A</i> will be filed together in numerical
sequence.</p>

<p>When a record of goods received has been made on the forms
prescribed, the purchasing agent's records will be complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p2">THE STORES DEPARTMENT</h3>

<p><b>15.</b> In this discussion, the <i>stores department</i>, or <i>stock department</i>
as it is frequently called, is treated as a subordinate division of
the purchasing department. Properly organized, it becomes one of
the most valuable from a profit-making standpoint. Without organization
it may degenerate into one of the most useless.</p>

<p>To attain the state of efficiency of which it is capable, the organization
and system of operation of the stores department must be of
the highest order, otherwise it cannot be expected to fulfill its mission.
So much has been written about the failure of stores departments
and stores systems to produce desired results, that a statement of
what is meant by <i>stores department</i> seems to be demanded before
we can arrive at intelligent conclusions regarding its functions and
operation.</p>

<p>Broadly, the stores department is that department of a business
which has the custody of its stock in trade, materials, supplies, and
other physical property, except real estate. Reduced to a concrete
example, in a trading business the term means that department which
is responsible for the storage and proper care of the goods purchased
for resale; also the materials and appliances required in the operation
of the business. There may be no department known by this name;
there may be no one man whose duty it is to supervise the work; nevertheless,
the department exists. Every clerk in a small retail store
may be a receiving clerk, a salesman, and a stores clerk; or in a
larger establishment several men may be employed as stockkeepers;
but in both cases the responsibilities of the stores department are
shouldered by some one, perhaps by several people.</p>

<p>Like every other department of a business, the organization of
a stores department depends largely upon the nature of the business.
To furnish an illustration that can be readily understood, we
will treat the organization and operation of the stores department from
the standpoint of a manufacturer.</p>

<h3 class="p2">ORGANIZATION</h3>

<p><b>16.</b> The stores department is properly under the direct supervision
of the purchasing agent. In the last analysis he is the man who
is responsible for the maintenance of a stock of materials and supplies
which will at all times be adequate for the business. It is proper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
therefore, that he should have supervision over the <i>receipt</i>, <i>storage</i>, and
<i>delivery</i> of the goods which he has purchased.</p>

<p>In the actual operation of the stores department, the purchasing
agent will delegate his authority to the chief stores clerk, who will in
turn be assisted by the necessary number of stock men and a receiving
clerk. It will be the duty of the chief stores clerk to see that all
materials are properly stored, to maintain the records prescribed,
and to furnish such reports as may be necessary regarding the movement
of the stock. He will have general supervision over the entire
department. In the actual physical operations of the department,
he will be assisted by stock men who are subject to his orders.</p>

<p>In small establishments the stores clerk also acts as receiving
clerk, but in the larger enterprises, a separate receiving clerk is required.
He will check the receipt of all goods, deliver them to the
storage places prescribed by the chief stores clerk, and make such
reports as may be prescribed. While he is, generally speaking, under
the orders of the chief stores clerk, he also makes certain reports
direct to the purchasing agent.</p>

<h3 class="p2">TAKING AN INVENTORY</h3>

<p><b>17.</b> Before a stores department can be successfully organized an
<i>inventory</i> must be taken, for this inventory will be the basis on which
the records of the stores department are founded.</p>

<p>Stores record systems are quite commonly referred to as perpetual
inventories, and, occasionally, such a system is pointed to as a
failure for the reason that at the end of the year, or other fiscal period,
the inventory, that is, the actual physical inventory of the stock, does
not check with the records. The fact that systems of stores records
have been regarded as inventories <i>in fact</i>, is responsible for most so-called
failures. Regarded in its proper relation, a perpetual inventory
is nothing more nor less than an accurate accounting of all goods
that come into and go out of the establishment, these records to be
checked by an actual physical inventory with such regularity and
frequency that the accounts can safely be considered as exhibiting a
correct inventory. In considering the question, how to take an inventory,
we refer, therefore, to an actual physical inventory, that is,
a count of every article in stock. When once this inventory is taken
and properly recorded, it is entirely possible to install and maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
systems which will make it unnecessary to inventory all of the physical
property at any one time.</p>

<p>It has been the general custom in a large manufacturing establishment
to shut down for a period of greater or less duration, running
all the way from two or three days to as many weeks, for the purpose
of taking an inventory. Since it has been considered necessary to
shut down for this purpose, inventories have, as a rule, been taken
but once a year. All this is unnecessary, for, with proper methods,
it is possible to take even a complete inventory without perceptible
interruption of the operation of the plant. The first step is to decide,
at just what time the inventory is to be taken, and to have all foremen
get their shops in readiness. This means a general cleaning up
which will make it easy to locate and count, weigh, or measure the
<i>materials</i>, <i>tools</i>, <i>supplies</i>, and <i>work in process</i>. Then, at a specified
time the work of taking the inventory should be started simultaneously
in every shop.</p>

<p>The making of the necessary records will be in charge of a clerk
who will be assisted by the foremen and as many helpers as may be
required. Each clerk is given a supply of tags, ruled as shown in
Fig. 14. These are made in the form of shipping tags, but larger than
the usual sizes used for that purpose. It will be noted that the tag
is perforated near the top. The portion above the perforation shows
the season and date of inventory, the card number, and the department.
The card number and the department are repeated on the lower part of
the card, which is also divided into two parts. The upper half is for
an inventory of material, finished stores, and work in process, divided
as to <i>description</i>, <i>name of last operation</i>, the <i>quantity</i>, and the <i>unit</i>.
The lower half is for an inventory of tools, machinery, equipment, and
supplies, with provision for the <i>description</i>, <i>quantity</i>, <i>unit</i>, <i>numbers</i>,
and <i>location</i>. By <i>unit</i> is meant the unit in which the material or
supplies are priced, as pounds, yards, dozen, gross, etc.</p>

<p>The first operation is to attach one of these cards, which are
consecutively numbered, to each machine, tool, bin, rack, or pile of
material. Then the clerk and his assistants will go through the shop
and weigh and count the material represented by each tag, recording
the items on the tag itself. As this is done, the lower half of the tag
is torn off. Since a record is kept of the card numbers given to each
clerk, it will be necessary for him to turn in every one, and if care is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
used in placing the tag on every article before the count has begun,
there is no possibility of material being overlooked. As a further
precaution against the loss of cards, the remaining part of the tag is
afterward removed and sent to the office for checking against the
main record. As
the tag is used
merely to insure
a record of quantities
of all property,
it is unnecessary
to include
prices.</p>

<p>With this
method an inventory
can be
taken in a very
short time.
There are cases
on record where
an inventory in
the largest industrial
enterprises
has been taken
by this method
without shutting
down the plant
in any department
for a longer
period than two
days.</p>

<p><b>18. Inventory
Records.</b>
When the physical
inventory has been taken, the next step is to record quantities
and prices, and make the extensions that the record may show total
values. The records of the inventory should be classified; that is,
all material or equipment of a certain class should be recorded on
the same form, so that the total value of each class can be ascertained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>For a manufacturing business, the inventory is subdivided as
follows:</p>

<p class="pn10r p1">
Machinery and Equipment.<br />
Machine Tools.<br />
Small Tools.<br />
Drawings and Patterns.<br />
Materials and Supplies.<br />
Parts and Finished Stores.<br />
Work in Process.<br />
Manufactured Goods.</p>

<p class="p1">One form might be made to answer the purpose for all these
inventories, but as certain special information is needed in each case,
it is considered the better plan to use special forms. We, accordingly,
illustrate forms for each of these classes.</p>

<p><i>Machinery and Equipment.</i> Under this heading is listed all
<i>machinery</i>, <i>furniture</i>, <i>office appliances</i>, and <i>equipment</i> of all classes
required in the operation of the business. The form for the inventory
is shown in Fig. 15, this being a loose-leaf form, about 10 x 12 inches
in size.</p>

<p>For this section, a sheet is used for each specific class of equipment,
and, where the same class of equipment is required in different
buildings or departments, a sheet is used for each department. For
instance, all typewriters used in a given department will be inventoried
on one sheet, and no other equipment will be inventoried on the same
sheet.</p>

<p>The information given at the head of the sheet includes the
<i>location</i>, <i>cost</i>, <i>estimated life</i>, <i>name</i>, <i>series number</i>, <i>our number</i>, and
<i>from whom purchased</i>. The form provides for a record of date
(meaning date purchased), and description of the equipment, original
cost, cost of additions and repairs, per cent and amount of depreciation,
and the net value. Reference to this record shows the exact
number of machines of a given class in use and just where they are
being used.</p>

<p><i>Machine Tools.</i> Under the head of machine tools, an inventory
covers all tools of this character, whether purchased or manufactured
in the plant. Since large plants usually manufacture their own
machine tools, this form is used to show <i>date of manufacture or purchase</i>,
<i>description</i>, <i>cost of material and labor</i>, <i>per cent</i>, and amount
added to cover the <i>factory burden</i>, and the <i>total cost</i>. Like the form
used for machinery and equipment, all machine tools of a given class
should be inventoried on the same sheet, Fig. 16.</p>

<p><i>Small Tools.</i> Most small tools are purchased, but some of them
may be made in the plant. These tools may be purchased singly, or
in lots of one dozen, or in other quantities. To meet these conditions
the form, Fig. 17, provides for a record of <i>date of purchase</i>, <i>description</i>,
<i>quantity</i>, <i>unit</i>, <i>material and labor costs</i>, <i>per cent and amount of burden</i>,
and <i>total cost</i>. When the tools are purchased ready for use, only the
last money column is used.</p>

<p><i>Drawings</i> and <i>Patterns</i>. This inventory includes all drawings
and patterns that are in use or of value to the business. In placing
a value on this property, conservatism is necessary. A new pattern
is supposedly worth what it cost to manufacture it. But a pattern
may become obsolete in a very short time. It is necessary, therefore,
when taking the inventory, to estimate the probable life of all patterns,
basing this estimate not only on wear and tear, but on the probability
of their being replaced by later models. The cost of drawings and
patterns should be entirely absorbed in the cost of the goods manufactured,
and to cover this a very liberal rate of depreciation must be
provided. In the inventory form we do not show the depreciation,
as we consider it more practicable to take a complete inventory, and
make a new appraisal of drawings and patterns at the end of each
fiscal period. The form given for this inventory, Fig. 18, shows
<i>date put in stock</i>, the <i>number</i>, <i>description</i>, and <i>details of cost</i>.</p>

<p><i>Material</i> and <i>Supplies</i>. The inventory of material and supplies
includes all material which goes into the construction of the goods and
all supplies required in the operation of the plant.</p>

<p>In recording this inventory, supplies and material should be kept
separate, and each should be thoroughly classified. One sheet should
show but one special class; that is, if one of the items is hardware,
nothing but the hardware inventory should be included on the same
sheet. This form, shown in Fig. 19, gives the <i>description</i>, the <i>purpose
for which the material is used</i>, <i>quantity in stock</i>, <i>unit of measure</i>,
<i>unit value</i>, and <i>total value</i>.</p>

<p><i>Parts</i> and <i>Finished Stores</i>. This section is intended to include
all finished parts in a plant manufacturing parts to be later assembled
into complete machines, also any finished stores or semi-completed
parts. Under the latter head would come such items as castings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
which are made in advance, to be used as needed. This inventory
is recorded on the form shown in Fig. 20, giving the <i>description</i>, <i>for
what used</i>, <i>the number of the part</i>, <i>quantity</i>, <i>unit</i>, <i>unit value</i>, and <i>total
value</i>.</p>

<p><i>Work in Process.</i> Under the head of <i>work in process</i> is included
all partially completed orders in the plant at the time of inventory.
If an efficient cost system has been maintained, it will not be a difficult
matter to arrive at accurate costs of all such material. Without
a cost system it is necessary to use extreme care in estimating the
cost of material and labor to date.</p>

<p>One of the most important items of information in this inventory
is the last operation, which means the last completed operation. It
is necessary to have this information before we can figure the actual
cost. The form for this inventory, Fig. 21, includes <i>description</i>,
<i>name of last operation</i>, <i>cost of material</i>, <i>cost of labor</i>, <i>per cent and
amount of burden</i>, and <i>total value</i>.</p>

<p><i>Manufactured Goods.</i> The inventory of manufactured goods
includes all goods completed ready for the market. In a trading
business this would include the regular stock in trade. Fig. 22
shows a form for the inventory of manufactured goods, which,
with slight changes, would answer the purpose for the stock in a
trading business. The form shows the <i>order number</i> (meaning the
shop order number on which the goods were manufactured), the
<i>description</i>, the <i>quantity</i>, the <i>material and labor costs</i>, the <i>burden</i>, and
<i>total value</i>.</p>

<p>When these inventories are completed, and the extensions made,
it will be seen that a complete record of values of all physical property
is provided. From these records the ledger accounts should be adjusted
so that all records will correspond. The records also furnish
the necessary information from which to make the stores record,
which is necessary when installing the system.</p>

<p>These inventory sheets may be filed either in the drawers of a
vertical file or in a loose-leaf binder, though the latter is preferred.
The sheets for each class should be kept by themselves and classified
as explained above. The index may be alphabetical, or blank indexes,
on which the names of the classes are written, may be used.
The sheets in each class should be numbered consecutively and kept
in numerical sequence.</p>

<h3 class="p2">STORES DEPARTMENT A MONEY SAVER</h3>

<p><b>19.</b> Although a stores department is the first essential in the
operation of a cost accounting system, manufacturers sometimes
hesitate to install such a department on the ground of expense. Without
considering its valuable features, the claim is made that the operation
of this department involves a larger expenditure than is warranted
by the results. But such claims are not borne out by the experience
of manufacturers who have tested the efficiency of the department.
Where results are found which appear to support this claim, investigation
will invariably reveal faulty installation or faulty operation, or
both.</p>

<p>Opposed to this claim, the experiences of many manufacturers
show that the stores department is an actual money saver. If anything
like an efficient cost-accounting system is to be maintained, a
stores department is an absolute necessity; but even if there is no cost
system, a stores department can be made profitable. An adequate
system of records in a well-organized stores department will show at
all times the exact condition of the stock, and this alone should justify
the maintenance of such a department. Slow moving stocks are
pointed out, so that a greater effort may be made to move them; if a
stock is running low, the records give warning before the danger point
is reached. All this applies with the same force to a trading business
as to a manufacturing enterprise. By showing the volume of stock
on hand, by pointing out its movements, a stores-record system prevents
the accumulation of <i>dead</i> stock, yet makes it possible to maintain
active stocks at the lowest volume consistent with safety, and
thereby saves money by keeping the investment at the lowest possible
point.</p>

<p>Surprising results in money saving through stores-record systems
have been shown by some manufacturers. In one case which came
within the writer's observation, a reduction of more than $10,000.00 in
the average investment was made. A certain manufacturer of machinery,
who had an inadequate stores system, found that his stock of
material averaged $30,000.00, while the business required a stock of
not more than $20,000.00. He engaged a competent man to install
and operate the system, paid him a liberal salary, and at the end of a
year found that his stock averaged less than $20,000.00. Moreover,
the stock was clean&mdash;there being nothing in it that was not needed&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
well arranged, and in every respect in a more satisfactory condition
than before. That meant a saving of the earnings of $10,000.00,
and by using it in extending his business, the money was worth 20%
to him.</p>

<h3 class="p2">INSTALLING A STORES SYSTEM</h3>

<p><b>20.</b> When the inventory has been completed, the next important
step in the organization of a stores department is to provide the necessary
<i>storage</i> places for all materials and supplies and see that these
are properly stored.</p>

<p>The question, as to what is a proper storage place is one which
must be worked out to fit conditions as found in the individual establishment.
Generally speaking, in a manufacturing business, materials
should be located as closely as possible to the departments in
which they will be used. In a large plant it is usually necessary to
have several storerooms to accommodate the various classes of
material, and in order that they may be located conveniently. The
question of proper storage is a vitally important one in every business,
and especially so in a manufacturing plant. Ideal conditions
are impossible to obtain in all plants, but the first consideration should
be to have a definite storage place for every class of material, and to
always keep the material in that especial place. Go into a plant
having no well-defined system of storage, and you will find workmen
spending more time looking for materials needed than would have
been required to take the same material to a stockroom and withdraw
it as needed. In trading businesses the necessity for systematic
stock keeping has long been recognized. Wholesale houses have
their stock arranged in departments and stored on different floors of
the warehouse with special men in charge of stock keeping. A retailer,
no matter whether he is operating a department store or dealing
exclusively in one class of merchandise, has his goods arranged by
departments. But in too many manufacturing plants the question
of storage for raw material and supplies has received little consideration.
A manufacturer will invest dollars in raw material and keep
no record of it; yet the same man would regard as preposterous the
suggestion that he should keep no record of cash. As a matter of
fact, the material should be as well cared for, and as strictly accounted
for, as cash. Every dollar's worth of material should be
regarded in the same light as a dollar in gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Next in importance to the location of the storerooms is the question
of the storage of the material itself. The storerooms should be
equipped with such bins, racks, shelves, boxes, and drawers as may
be required for the proper care of the material. In storing the material
the question of its size and weight, and the frequency with
which it will be needed, should be considered. Extremely heavy
articles should not be stored on the floor, but should be raised to
about the height of a truck, thus saving labor both in unloading and
loading. Material which is constantly being called for should be
kept on shelves that are within easy reach. The top shelves and inaccessible
corners can be reserved for articles seldom called for. As
far as possible, all articles of the same class should be kept in the
same section of the storeroom. Above all, a given article should
always be kept in the same place. In some storerooms it is not uncommon
to find, hidden away in some dark corner, articles which are
not supposed to be in stock, all because no definite storage place has
been provided. The record system can be of little value unless the
articles are to be found in the sections allotted to them.</p>

<p>All of this but emphasizes the importance of having the storeroom
and stores system under the exclusive control of one man. No
one should be allowed to interfere with the work of the chief stores
clerk. If there is any cause for criticism it should be taken to his
superior. Suggestions from foremen and others who are obliged
to make use of the storeroom, should, and probably will, be welcomed
by the average stores clerk, but no foreman should instruct one of his
men to place material in the storeroom except as instructed by its
head.</p>

<p>Aside from the storeroom proper, the stores clerk will have
charge of material stored outside of the plant. Lumber, fuel, and
heavy castings are examples of material coming under this head.
Nevertheless, his records should include all of this material, and he
should have general supervision over its storage in order that he may
more readily determine, or more closely estimate, quantities in stock.</p>

<p><b>21. Receiving.</b> In the organization of the <i>stores department</i>,
it is necessary to provide for a record of the <i>receipt</i> of all material and
supplies. The system must be so constructed that it will not only
insure a record of all goods coming into the establishment, but prevent
the acceptance of goods which should not be received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>All receiving should, therefore, be in charge of one man. In the
larger industrial enterprises, a receiving clerk is employed, whose
duty is to receive and receipt for all goods coming into the establishment,
and to deliver them to the storeroom or the department in
which they are to be used. The stores clerk may, in a small concern,
perform all of the functions of the receiving clerk.</p>

<p>When goods come in, the receiving clerk will refer to his file of
purchase order copies to find if the goods have been ordered. It
will be remembered that an alphabetical file has been recommended
for these orders, which are to be filed under the name of the shipper.
The reason for this is that the package does not always show the
nature of its contents, while the name of the shipper is almost invariably
shown somewhere on the package or on the shipping tag.</p>

<p>Goods should not be accepted by the receiving clerk unless he
has an order. To do so is liable to cause trouble. As an illustration,
we will suppose that the concern has made a contract for material
on which deliveries are to be made at stated intervals. The first
shipment received shows that the material is not up to specifications
and the contract is cancelled. Pending an adjustment, the receiving
clerk is instructed to accept no more material on the contract. If he
does so, the concern will very likely be obliged to pay for it, and it
may even have a bearing on the entire contract.</p>

<p>Another class of shipments which must be carefully watched is
the return of goods by customers of the concern. In some businesses,
this question is not important; in others, great care must be exercised
to insure proper credit. In a manufacturing or a trading business
other than retail, the customer will usually notify the house that he is
returning goods. When such a notice is received, instructions should
be given to the receiving clerk whether to accept or refuse them.</p>

<p>One class of business in which the receipt of returned goods must
be handled with extreme care is the installment business. Most installment
contracts vest title to the goods in the seller until all payments
are made. To avoid payment, a customer may return goods
without notice. Acceptance by the seller cancels the contract at
once. A safe rule to follow, therefore, is to accept no returned goods
until authorized to do so by one in authority.</p>

<p>The receiving slip, Fig. 13, Page 16, is to be filled out by the
receiving clerk. One copy will go to the purchasing agent and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
other to the stores clerk. From these reports the stores clerk makes
his record of material received. In some cases material ordered for
the use of a particular department is to be sent direct to the department
and not to the storeroom. A third copy of the report should be
made which will be sent to the department, from whence it will go to
the stores clerk, properly receipted.</p>

<p><b>22. Deliveries.</b> The stores clerk, being in custody of all stock,
is responsible not alone for its safe keeping but for deliveries. He
must be in a position to show what stock has been delivered, to whom,
and for what purpose.</p>

<p>There is but one method that will insure an accurate record of
deliveries and that is, to deliver no goods without a written order or
requisition, signed by one having authority to authorize withdrawals.</p>

<p>Each department, or shop, should be supplied with storeroom
requisitions, numbered consecutively with the department number
or letter; that is, a requisition from one shop might be numbered
<i>B</i> 100, another <i>C</i> 100. These requisitions should be made in duplicate
or triplicate. When the duplicate form is used, the original is
sent to the stores clerk and the duplicate retained by the foreman.
When the stores clerk has completed his records and the foreman has
received the material, both copies are to be sent to the cost department.
One copy acts as a check against the other, making it impossible
for either the stores clerk or foreman to make false returns.
To make identification easy, the two blanks should be printed on
paper of contrasting colors. In the cost department one copy should
be filed according to the department in which the requisition originated,
keeping the numbers consecutive, and the other under the production
or job order number. On completion of the order, the latter
copy can be destroyed as it will no longer be needed. The departmental
copies may also be destroyed, say at the end of a three months'
period.</p>

<p>Sometimes it will be found advisable for the stores clerk to retain
a copy of the requisition, in which event the triplicate form will be
used, two copies being sent to him. He will file his copy by production
order numbers, if for material, or by departmental numbers, if for
supplies.</p>

<p>All requisitions should provide for a record of prices and values,
these to be entered in the cost department. If this is omitted it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
be necessary for the cost clerk to enter the items and extend cost on
another blank; when included, he can post values direct from the
requisition to the permanent cost records. Place should also be provided
on the requisition for the signature of the one who receives the
material.</p>

<p>A form of requisition adapted to the use of the average manufacturing
enterprise is shown in Fig. 23. This form shows the <i>department
number</i>, the <i>date</i>, the <i>production order number</i>, <i>quantity</i>,
<i>description</i>, <i>cost</i>, and <i>value</i>. At the bottom the necessary <i>form of
receipt</i> is provided. Usually this form will be found adequate for both
material and supplies. When used for supplies, the purpose for
which they are intended is to be inserted in place of the production
order number. Special forms for supplies and repair material are
used in some plants. These should differ in color from the <i>material</i>
requisitions. A form of this character is illustrated in Fig. 24.</p>

<h3 class="p2">STORES RECORDS</h3>

<p><b>23.</b> The installation of a stores-record system calls for the exercise
of judgment of the highest order, for the record of material and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
supplies is of no less importance than the record of cash. As has
already been stated, material should be accounted for with the same
fidelity as cash; a dollar's worth of material should be regarded as a
dollar in gold.</p>

<p>The stores record system should be an integral part of the accounting
system of a business; it should be checked as carefully as
any account in the ledger. Only by making the stores record a part
of the accounting system can it be operated successfully.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-058.jpg" width="400" height="258"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 24. Special Departmental Requisition for Material</p>
</div></div>

<p>Stores records may be divided into two classes&mdash;one recording
both quantities and values, and one recording quantities only. Frequently
both classes are used in one establishment. In the storeroom
a system is maintained which records quantities without prices; in
the cost department a record of values and quantities may be kept.</p>

<p>The records kept in the storeroom are primarily intended to
show quantities on hand, or rather quantities that should be on hand.
Sometimes these records show prices, but there appears to be no good
reason why this should be done. It is better to have all accounting
of values done in the accounting department.</p>

<p>The records under consideration are those of the storeroom.
These records must show <i>quantities received</i> and <i>quantities issued</i>,
from which a record of the quantity on hand can be obtained. To
supply the necessary information, the records must show quantities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of each article or kind of material in stock, which necessitates a system
of units. Some articles will move much more rapidly than others;
therefore, a bound book is not practical. Either cards or loose leaves
can be used successfully, a card or sheet being used for the record of
each article.</p>

<p>In order that the records may be instantly available, they must be
properly classified. The classifications should follow the same lines
as the ledger accounts, which will correspond with the classifications
adopted in recording the original inventory. Records of material
and supplies should be separated, and each divided into classes. The
cards or loose leaves should be filed and indexed according to these
classifications.</p>

<p>For example, we will suppose that one division of the material
account is hardware. On one index will be written the word <i>Hardware</i>,
the index forming a main division. Back of the index all cards
or sheets recording articles that come in the hardware classification
will be filed, these records also being properly classified and subdivided.
In the hardware stock will be found screws of several
classes, as round-head bright, round-head blued, flat-head bright,
flat-head blued. In the <i>S</i> section, back of <i>Hardware</i>, one index will
be headed <i>Screws</i>. This division will be subdivided by indexes
headed with the names of the classes or kinds of screws. The stores
record cards or sheets will then be filed back of these subdivision
indexes in the order of sizes. A card or sheet may be used for each
size, or several sizes may be recorded on the same sheet.</p>

<p><b>24. Verification of Stores Records.</b> When indexed in this
manner the stores record of any article can be quickly located, and the
sectional divisions will assist greatly in verifying the records. While
the stores records are intended merely as records of material in stock,
their accuracy must be verified by an actual inventory, just as the cash
account is verified by a count of cash on hand. However, if thoroughly
classified, it is not necessary to verify all of the stores records
at one time; they can be verified by sections, or the record of a single
article can be verified by an article inventory, without regard to other
records.</p>

<p>Accounts in the ledger should be arranged to correspond with
the stores classifications, that is, purchase accounts should be carried
with materials forming the main divisions of the stores records; as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
<i>Hardware</i>, <i>Bar Steel</i>, <i>Foundry Material</i>, <i>Foundry Supplies</i>, and
<i>Factory Supplies</i>. When the stock of one class, as hardware, is inventoried,
the result should be recorded on the regular inventory
sheet, priced, and extended, and the total compared with the hardware
purchase account in the ledger. Any discrepancies should be
adjusted at once, but if the records are carefully kept, and an inventory
of each class is taken two or three times a year, the discrepancies
should be practically nil.</p>

<p>If the routine prescribed is faithfully followed, there is no theoretical
reason why stores records should not check as closely as cash,
with the possible exception of bulk stores, like fuel and ores, where
estimates are necessary. Even then, if inventories are taken when
these stores are at the lowest point, there should be little difficulty in
arriving at accurate results. However, the greatest responsibility
rests on the chief stores clerk. He must not let a single pound of
material leave the storeroom without an order, for it is on the accuracy
of his records that all of the accounts are based. The order
copies received in the cost department furnish the basis for all material
charges. Here prices are entered and extensions are made.
The chief cost clerk will transmit to the chief accountant weekly or
monthly recapitulations of all material charged out. The chief
accountant will credit his purchase accounts and debit <i>Manufacturing</i>,
<i>Maintenance</i>, <i>Repair</i>, or <i>Expense</i> accounts as the case may be. <i>Purchase</i>
accounts thus become <i>controlling</i> accounts of the stores records,
and the latter takes its legitimate place as an integral part of the accounting
system.</p>

<h3 class="p2">RECORD FORMS</h3>

<p><b>25.</b> All forms for stores records, no matter what the class of
material recorded, possess certain characteristics in common; yet the
information required about each special class is usually of such nature
that a special form is advisable. This may mean the use of several
forms in the same establishment.</p>

<p>When installing any system, however, it is more economical to
invest more money in printing and have forms that fit exactly, than to
attempt to make special records conform to forms prepared for other
purposes. If certain specific information is required, the form
should be designed to exhibit just that information, and if the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
is properly designed, the saving of time both in recording and consulting
the record will much more than offset the slight additional
cost of special printing.</p>

<p>The number of forms must not be so large as to cause confusion,
but against the opposite extreme the cost of time must be considered.
It will be found that the value of clerks' time is greater than the cost of
printing.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 25. Form for a Stock Record of Materials and Supplies</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>26. Material and Supplies.</b> For material and supplies the same
form will be found satisfactory in most establishments. The form
should provide for the name of the material, the unit in which it is
purchased, the purpose for which used, the location in the storeroom,
and quantities received and delivered. Fig. 25 shows a form designed
for records of this class. In addition to the headings specified above,
spaces will be noted at the top of this card for <i>maximum</i> and <i>minimum</i>.
These refer to the quantities of material to be carried in
stock and represent the high and low limits. These limits should
be established for each article in stock and when any article
reaches the low limit a report should be sent to the purchasing
agent on the form shown in Fig. 11, Page 14. This form provides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
for a record of order numbers for all deliveries, a feature which
should be incorporated in all cases where the form is for the use of
a manufacturing business. At the extreme right is a column
headed <i>verified</i>. When an inventory is taken, the date and balance
on hand is to be entered under this head.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-062.jpg" width="400" height="254"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 26. Stock Record Form showing Orders Placed</p>
</div></div>

<p>A conventional form is shown in Fig. 26. The special feature
of this form is a column for a record of orders placed. Usually this
column is not required on the record of the stores clerk, but, if used,
the order numbers should be entered from the receiving clerk's copy
of the purchase order. On both of the forms illustrated several
columns are provided for <i>deliveries</i> to one for <i>receipts</i>. This is necessary,
as deliveries are in smaller quantities and much more frequent
than receipts.</p>

<p>Fig. 27 shows a form that includes <i>values</i> as well as quantities.
This is not considered necessary, as a rule, for the storeroom, but
where the stores records are kept in the factory office, as is sometimes
done, it is a good plan to include values. On the reverse side of this
form a complete record of orders is kept.</p>

<p>Another form that includes values is shown in Fig. 28. This form
is well adapted for a record of almost any class of material or supplies.</p>

<p>The form illustrated by Fig. 29 is specially adapted for a record
of supplies. Under the head of <i>distribution</i> the department to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>

<p><b>27. Parts and
Finished Stores.</b> A
record of parts and
finished stores is
very essential in
many manufacturing
enterprises.
The modern tendency
in machinery
manufacture, for
instance, is to
standardize production,
making all
parts interchangeable.
Parts are
manufactured in
large quantities, on
special orders, and
placed in stock until
needed.</p>

<p>It is very necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to know the condition of the stock of parts to insure against overstocking,
and to prevent the supply running low. A record of parts
should therefore be maintained on the same lines as for material and
supplies. Usually, a parts storeroom, with a clerk in charge, is
maintained apart from the material storeroom.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>The form illustrated by Fig. 30 is designed for a record of parts
and finished stores. This form provides for a record of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
information as given for material, with the addition of the number
and size of the part. No change is needed in the form of record of
receipts and deliveries.</p>

<p>Fig. 31 shows another form for parts. The special feature of
this form is the record of values, which is advisable if the records are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
kept in the cost department. Parts records are more frequently
kept in the cost department than material and supplies records.</p>

<p><b>28. Material Returned to Stock.</b> When a foreman receives an
order to manufacture a certain article, or part, he estimates the quantity
of material required and draws it from the storeroom. Naturally
he does not always estimate the exact quantity; he may run short or
have material left when the job is completed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-066.jpg" width="400" height="308"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 32. Record of Material Returned to Stock</p>
</div></div>

<p>Unless the material can be used immediately on another job, it
should be returned to stock, with a report to the stores department.
The form for such a report is shown in Fig. 32. An essential feature
of this form is the order number for which the material was drawn,
this being the production or shop order number.</p>

<p>When the stores clerk receives unused material and this report,
he will enter the quantity on the stores record under the head of <i>receipts</i>,
and forward the report to the cost department. The cost and
value will then be entered and credited on the cost records.</p>

<p><b>29. Material Transferred.</b> When a foreman has left-over material
which can be used on another job, a report is necessary to insure
credit to the job for which it was drawn and a charge to the job on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
which it was used. Fig. 33 is a form for this report. This shows the
numbers of the jobs for which the material was drawn and to which
the material has been transferred. After entering the correct quantities
on his stores record, he sends the report to the cost department.
If it is not considered necessary for the stores clerk to make these
corrections on his records, the report may be sent to the cost department
by the foreman.</p>

<h3 class="p2">MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT RECORDS</h3>

<p><b>30.</b> In every business enterprise there should be kept a record
that will give a full and complete history of every machine or other
article of permanent equipment. There are many ways in which
such a record will prove valuable.</p>

<p>Not infrequently a new part will be needed for a machine which
has been in use for several years. There may be no mark on the
machine showing the name of the manufacturer; perhaps no one
remembers from whom it was purchased. The result is a frenzied
search through books and files&mdash;confusion&mdash;a vexing delay&mdash;all for
the want of proper records.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-068.jpg" width="400" height="275"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">LATHE DEPARTMENT IN THE PLANT OF THE BURROUGHS ADDING MACHINE CO., DETROIT, MICH.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Or, there is a fire, resulting in the loss of a machine costing
$3,000.00 that has been in use two years. The adjuster figures depreciation
at, say, 10% a year, or $600.00. There is no record showing
that it cost $400.00 additional to install the machine, or that
repairs have been put on it to maintain its efficiency. At least the
depreciation should be figured on a basis of $3,400.00, the real cost of
the machine.</p>

<p>A proper record would show the original cost, the amount expended
for repairs and additions, and the amount charged off for
depreciation. Such a record should be kept, but no special form is
required. The machine inventory form, Fig. 15, answers the purpose.
For the more important machinery, one of these sheets should
be used for each machine. These sheets constitute a machinery and
equipment ledger, controlled by the machinery and equipment accounts
in the general or special ledger. Thus the connection between
these records and the general accounting system is maintained.</p>

<h3 class="p2">THE TOOL ROOM</h3>

<p><b>31.</b> One department of a factory that is either a source of expense
or a factor in saving money, according to the way it is conducted, is
the tool room. The tool storeroom is referred to here, rather than
the department maintained by large manufacturing enterprises for
the manufacture of machine tools.</p>

<p>Every manufacturer is obliged to maintain a complete stock of
tools of sufficient size to meet the requirements of his establishment.
Unless these tools are properly cared for, the investment is very liable
to creep up to a point entirely out of proportion to the requirements.</p>

<p>Perhaps no class of property in a manufacturing plant is so frequently
lost as small tools. When no storage place is provided,
workmen are liable to leave tools where they were last used. They
are soon scattered about the shops and, because they are not readily
found, new tools are purchased.</p>

<p>A special tool room is usually necessary, though in some cases
the tools can be stored and cared for in the material storeroom. In
plants manufacturing machine tools for their own use, the foreman
of the tool department can care for the small tools in connection with
his regular work. It is also the duty of this department to keep the
tools in proper condition for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>For the storage of tools there should be provided racks and bins
in suitable sizes. All tools should be numbered and the sections of
the tool rack given corresponding numbers. For example, the stock
includes one dozen hammers of a given size and style. This tool is
given number twenty and the number is stamped on each hammer.
The hammers are placed in section number twenty of the tool rack.
At the same time twelve brass checks are stamped with the same
number and hung on a hook above the section containing the tools.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-071.jpg" width="400" height="334"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 34. Section of Rack for the Storage of Small Tools</p>
</div></div>

<p>A section of such a tool rack, showing the number checks, is
illustrated in Fig. 34.</p>

<p>There are several methods of keeping track of tools issued to
workmen. In some plants a written receipt is required for each tool
issued, but this plan is not recommended for the reason that the workman
should not be asked to take the time to write a receipt, or to wait
until it is made out by the tool-room foreman. He should be given
the tool promptly and the system employed should not cause him to
waste time.</p>

<p>To overcome these difficulties, the check system is used. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
are several variations in the operation of this system, but, in the
opinion of the writer, the double check system is the most practical
and satisfactory.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-072.jpg" width="200" height="410"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 35. Board on which<br /> Tool Checks
are Kept</p>
</div></div>

<p>First, the tools are numbered, as described above, and a brass
check provided for each tool. Then a board, divided into squares,
as shown in Fig. 35, is prepared. In these squares the names or
numbers of the men obliged to
draw tools are written. Each
square contains two hooks on one
of which twelve checks bearing
the man's number are hung.
When workman No. 2 receives
tool No. 15, one of the No. 2
checks is taken from the board
and hung above section No. 15
in the tool rack; at the same time
one of the No. 15 tool checks is
hung on the second hook in the
No. 2 square on the board.</p>

<p>It will be readily seen that
there must be, at all times, twelve
checks in each square on the
board, counting both tool and
workman's checks. Reference to
the tool rack will show how many
tools have been issued and what
workman has them. The advantage
of this system is that it
is practically automatic. A perfect
record of the movement of
tools is kept without the necessity
of making entries on cards or in books.</p>

<p>Another method of operating the double check system is to
supply the workman with a number of tool checks, these checks
bearing the workman's number. When he wishes to withdraw a
tool he presents one of these checks, which is hung above the tool
rack. One of the checks bearing the tool number is then placed on
the hook under the workman's number on the board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>One disadvantage of this system is that the workman is more
liable to lose checks than he is to lose tools. Theoretically, the number
of checks in possession of the workman at any time, added to
the number of checks on his hook on the board, should equal the
number originally given to him. If, however, he loses a check, it
usually means a dispute, as the workmen naturally does not feel that
he should be penalized by failure to return a check on which no tool
has been issued. All things considered, the method first described
is probably the most satisfactory.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig 36. Special Stock Record of Machine Tools</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>32. Tool Records.</b> While the system described above furnishes
a complete check on the tools, it should be supplemented by a record
which will serve as a perpetual record of values. The tools may be
divided into two classes, namely, <i>machine</i> tools, and <i>small</i> tools, each
requiring a somewhat different form of record.</p>

<p>Fig. 36 is the form of record for machine tools, this being on
either a card or loose leaf. One card is used for each tool required.
The record shows the name of the tool, the number, size, purpose for
which used, and date made. Below this is a complete record of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
cost, showing quantity manufactured, cost of material, labor, and
burden. When tools are destroyed a record is made showing date
and value, and the balance on hand is debited in the last column.</p>

<p>For small tools Fig. 37 is used. This record shows much the
same information as for machine tools. The special feature of this
form is the record of quantities received from time to time, number
delivered and returned, and number destroyed. As a rule, it is unnecessary
to record deliveries on this card, though in the case of some
very expensive tools, it may be advisable to do so.</p>

<p>Both of the forms referred to above are filed in the same manner
as other stores-record cards. The main divisions would be by name,
or by departments, with subdivisions according to size.</p>

<h2 class="p4">RECORDS OF LABOR AND MANUFACTURING ORDERS</h2>

<hr class="dec1" />

<h3 class="p2">LABOR RECORDS</h3>

<p><b>1.</b> The successful outcome of any project, in whatever field of
endeavor, depends on the coöperation of labor. Labor is energy
applied. The intelligence with which the energy is applied determines
its productiveness. The unskilled laborer applies energy, in
the form of his own strength, directly to the task before him. The
skilled worker uses his skill to direct the energy of nature that has
been applied to propel machines and appliances, which in turn have
been created by the skillful manipulation of inanimate properties.
Thus the combination of natural forces and the intelligent application
of those forces, under the direction of a skilled man, result in
the highest degree of productiveness.</p>

<p>In the employment of labor, there are two parties to be considered&mdash;the
employer of labor and the seller of labor. The desire
of the first is to secure the results of the labor at the lowest possible
cost per unit of production rather than at the lowest cost per individual.
The desire of the second is to secure the highest price
for his labor, based on the unit of time rather than on the unit of
production.</p>

<p>In the final analysis, the desires of the two are found not to be
inconsistent, nor opposed to each other. The employer cares little
what labor costs per unit of time, provided the cost per unit of production
is kept down to the lowest point; the seller of labor cares
not how many units of production result from his labor provided he
is paid a satisfactory wage.</p>

<p>The ideal method of regulating the payment of wages is, therefore,
one which will insure to the laborer a high wage under conditions
resulting in a correspondingly high rate of production. To
solve this problem, to evolve an ideal system, has long been the
study of engineers. The studies of these men are bound to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
far-reaching effect. From the older method of an exclusive day
wage to the modern systems that combine day wage and piece rates,
is a long step. Investigations and experiments, now going on in all
directions, are carrying the movement forward, and are destined
to evolve an ideal system.</p>

<h3 class="p2">WAGE SYSTEMS</h3>

<p><b>2.</b> Wage systems, as applied to manufacturing industries, may
be divided into the general classifications of day wage, piece rate,
and premium systems. Besides these three, there are a number of
systems, bearing the names of their originators, which are the result
of a combination of certain features found in two or more of the
three general methods. A study of modern wage systems necessarily
involves a study of the distinguishing features of the three primary
methods.</p>

<p><b>3. Day Wage.</b> Of the three general plans on which labor is
paid, the oldest and best known is the day-wage plan. It is the most
widely used because best understood. The day-wage plan contemplates
the payment of a stated wage for a stated unit of time.
If all men performing the same task were equally skillful, or if the
wage rate could be adjusted in conformity with the varying degrees
of productiveness found in every body of workmen, the day-wage
plan would be ideal. But neither of these conditions exists.</p>

<p>Workers are liable to insist on the application of the rule of
organized labor, that all men performing similar tasks shall be paid
the same wage. Since all men are not equally skillful, this results
in certain inequalities. On the one hand, the wage rate is based
on the lowest rate of production, which is unjust to the more skillful
man, who either reduces his productiveness to the level of the least
skillful, or transfers his energies to another field of endeavor. As an
opposite extreme, the rate is based on the highest rate of production,
which is manifestly unfair to the employer.</p>

<p>In actual practice, then, it is necessary, from the standpoint of
the employer, to employ overseers to drive all workmen to a maximum
rate of production, which, theoretically, means the elimination of
all workers who are unable to attain the maximum. Again an injustice
results, this time to the weaker man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p><b>4. Piece Rate.</b> The first plan evolved, in the search for a plan
that would remedy the inequalities of the day-wage plan, was the
piece-rate plan. The piece-rate plan contemplates the payment of
a stated wage per unit of production, without consideration of the
rate of production.</p>

<p>The argument was advanced that a uniform rate per unit of
production would result in an equitable wage, because based on the
productive skill of the individual. But the plan has failed in many
cases to produce the desired results, for the reason that it does not
take into consideration the factor of time.</p>

<p>In the establishment of a wage rate, the factor of time must be
considered, or the rate will not be equitable as between employer
and employe. The employer must furnish the shop, the tools,
the power, the heat and light. The cost of these items does not
necessarily vary in direct ratio with the increase or decrease in production.
These expenses must be absorbed by the finished product,
therefore, even under a piece-rate plan, the rate of production (the
factor of time) has an actual bearing on the rate per unit.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the employer, the rate per unit should
be based on the productiveness of the individual, and should insure
to the most skillful, a wage as high as, or slightly higher than, he would
receive under the day-wage plan. This would, in theory, give to
the less skillful man a wage exactly commensurate with his skill. But
as workers become more and more skillful, and increase at the same
time their productiveness and their earning capacity above normal,
there is a tendency on the part of the employer to reduce the rate
per unit to bring the aggregate wage back to normal. The result is
that the worker, fearing a reduction in the rate, limits his production
to the number of units that will insure an average wage.</p>

<p>Thus the system fails in its object. It does not reduce the cost
of production to the lowest point. However, when piece rates are
intelligently applied they are found very satisfactory in certain lines.
But in all cases, the piece rate tends toward a uniform rate of production,
and, while reducing the cost of superintendence, involves
the expense of inspection. The latter, however, is not necessarily
an added expense, for, as a rule, inspection is required regardless of
the wage system in use.</p>

<p><b>5. Premium Systems.</b> To obviate the difficulties found in both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the day-wage and piece-rate plans, the <i>premium</i> or <i>bonus</i> system
was evolved. This improved system of wages is intended to fulfill
the following conditions:</p>


<p class="pbqr p1">1. A guaranteed rate per hour for each grade of work for a contract
period.</p>

<p class="pbqr">2. An average earning power continuously higher than usual.</p>

<p class="pbqr">3. A lower cost per unit to the employer as wages automatically increase.</p>

<p class="pbqr">4. A supplemental earning power, or bonus, to the worker above the
day wage, the bonus being based on efficiency.</p>

<p class="p1">The premium system is a combination of day wage and piece
rate, involving the establishment of standard times for stated tasks.
It is based on the theory that if, when a standard time has been fairly
established, the worker performs a task in less than standard time,
he is entitled to a bonus, or extra pay, for the time saved. The bonus
is based on the wage rate paid for standard time.</p>

<p>For what part of the time saved the workman should be paid,
depends on circumstances. It might be argued that the workman
is entitled to full pay for all of the time saved, but other factors
than the dexterity of the workman enter into the time saving.
The employer supplies additional power, there is an extra cost for
wear and tear on machinery, and an extra quality of material; all
have a bearing on time saving. The employer is, therefore, entitled
to a part of the saving.</p>

<p>The original premium system is known as the <i>Halsey</i> plan.
There are, however, several well-known modifications of the plan,
all based on efficiency, but each having certain distinguishing characteristics.
No more clear presentation of the essential features
of the best known premium systems has been made, than is found in
a review by Mr. Carl Bender, published in the Engineering Magazine,
from which the following is quoted:</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">HALSEY PREMIUM PLAN</p>

<div class="reduct">

<p>To mitigate to some extent the evil workings of piece rates, Mr. F.
Halsey invented the premium plan shown in Fig. 1.</p>

<p>The slant of the wage line may be at any angle from horizontal, straight
piece rate, to coalescence with day rate line. This system possesses at least
four valuable points:</p>

<p class="pn10r p1">1. It pays day rates if a longer time is taken than standard.</p>

<p class="pn10r">2. It is a very flexible system and can be adapted to different conditions.</p>

<p class="pn10r">3. It lessens but does not obviate the necessity of changing rates.</p>

<p class="pn10r">4. It lessens but does not wholly remove the inclination to limit output.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">It is in one respect a step backward, since it substitutes uncertainty
for definiteness as to wage costs. Nevertheless, the Halsey system was an
admirable step in advance. Usually the worker is given either one-half or
one-third the time he saves. Psychologically it is much better than piece
rate, since most workers are more inclined to lessen their time than to increase
the number of pieces turned out. A man will deliberately decide that he
ought not to turn out more than five pieces a day, but he will not feel the
same desire to avoid breaking his own record of two hours per piece.</p>

<p>Under the Halsey system, no limit is placed on a man's earning power
per hour, and also a minimum piece rate of one-half or one-third the initial
rate per piece is allowed, so that if a man worked on his own time, he would
at least receive per piece one-half or one-third standard pay.</p></div>

<div class="reduct">

<p class="pc1 lmid">TAYLOR SYSTEM</p>

<p>A fundamental departure was made by Mr. Fred W. Taylor, in his
differential piece-rate system, a diagram of which is shown in Fig. 2. Mr.
Taylor does not establish an initial time by guess or by assuming a more
rapid gait than on day work, nor does he appropriate other unscientifically
determined times. His method is to standardize all conditions in the shop,
to make them as perfect and smoothly acting as circumstances will permit,
and then to determine a reasonable minimum time in which the job can be
done. As a result, Taylor's standard times are very much lower and also
very much more carefully and accurately determined than any system
hitherto considered. Mr. Taylor scorns the suggestion that by any chance
the worker could earn excessive wages. Any wages that an unusually efficient
worker can earn are legitimately his own. Assuming that under the Taylor
system a worker should do four pieces in four hours, his wages for the time
would be $1.00, but Mr. Taylor allows an increase of 20 per cent, 25 per cent,
30 per cent, or even more, according to the class of work, for ascertaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
standard time. Let us assume 20 per cent increase. The worker then receives
for four pieces in four hours, $1.20, a rate of $0.30 each. For less than
four pieces the maximum hourly rate is $0.25, therefore $0.25 each. If the
worker only delivers three pieces in four hours, his earnings are only $0.75,
or $0.1875 per hour. Mr. Taylor's system awards, therefore, a heavy and
increasing premium for high efficiency, a heavy penalty for low efficiency.</p>

<p>The method of standard time determination is so rigorous that the
worker cannot figure on curtailing his output. He has to hustle to make
wages even at the low piece rate, and if he succeeds in this, a very little extra
effort will give him a higher piece rate.</p>

<p>The excellence of the system lies in the accuracy with which proper
rates are predetermined. It is, however, somewhat inflexible and not so well
adapted to work in which unforeseeable variations in time occur.</p></div>

</div></div>

<div class="reduct">

<p class="pc1 lmid">THE GANTT BONUS SYSTEM</p>

<p>Mr. Gantt, a disciple of Mr. Taylor, introduced at the Bethlehem Steel
Company a bonus plan, see Fig. 3.</p>

<p>As in Mr. Taylor's system, the proper time is most carefully and accurately
predetermined. If the worker reaches the proper time, he is given
a bonus of 25 per cent above normal wages for the time. If he does still better,
he is given half of what he makes, as in the Halsey plan. If he does not reach
standard time, he is paid only 75 per cent of normal wages for the excessive
time, provided bonus earned permits the imposition of this fine. If he had
bonus to his credit he would not be fined, however much he fell below standard.</p>

<p>This system has shown certain psychological disadvantages in practice:</p>

<p>1. The men have made it a point of semi-honor, among themselves,
not to do better than standard times.</p>

<p>2. Although the actual fines for failing to reach standard times were
insignificant, the men claimed that they were being robbed of thousands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
dollars in this manner. Neither fall-downs nor ability to lessen standard
time are always up to the man. It is therefore unfortunate when a favorable
chance occurs to lessen time, that the worker deliberately holds back. It is
also often unjust that he should be fined for what may not be his fault.</p>

<p>Actual experience with these different wage systems brings out the
fact that psychology accounts for quite as much as any fair condition, and
that a good wage system must not only be fair but must also hit the men right.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">EMERSON EFFICIENCY SYSTEM</p>

<p>The most recent wage system is the Efficiency System, evolved and
perfected in theory by Mr. H. Emerson and his assistants and practically
applied by the officials in the shops of the Santa Fé Railway.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 3. Diagram of the Gantt Premium Wage System</p>
</div></div>

<div class="reduct">

<p>This wage system superficially resembles the Halsey line, Fig. 4,
but in theory and in fact differs radically from all previous wage systems,
although it embodies much that was best in all of them. It retains the principle
of day pay irrespective of performance. It retains in modified form
the principle of a flat piece rate. Like the Halsey system, it pays more per
piece for less competent work. Above all, it retains Mr. Taylor's and Mr.
Gantt's principle of accurate and scientific shop organization, including standard
times for every job and operation.</p>

<p>It pays a high premium above wage or piece rate for coöperation or
assistant foremanship on the part of the worker, and finally, as part of regular
and daily shop practice, it revises erroneous schedules whether they be too low
or too high, and it makes this revision without lessening the earning power
of the worker. In addition it substitutes for the costly, annoying, inaccurate
time recording of each job, a general monthly efficiency record which covers
the shop as a whole, each department, gang, foreman, worker and job, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
based on accurate study and efficiency, it predetermines, before work is begun,
the absolute cost of every operation.</p>

<p>These results are facilitated by recognizing that the attainment of
standard conditions as to all operations depends on four totally different
elements:</p>

<p class="pnr">(1) The shop itself must be highly organized and efficiently operated. This
is a duty that devolves solely on the management, and for poor organization
and operation the worker is not responsible.</p>

<p class="pnr">(2) The character of the work itself, the quality of materials, etc., may vary
greatly on the same job at different times. Neither manager nor worker
is wholly responsible for this variation.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 4. Diagram of the Emerson Efficiency Wage System</p>
</div></div>

<div class="reduct">

<p class="pnr">(3) Assuming standard shop and work conditions, the worker himself can
do much to coöperate with the management in making the other conditions
as well as himself effective.</p>

<p class="pnr">(4) Costs should be standardized for the shop on a basis of normal conditions
and be adjusted in the counting room on the basis of the monthly
efficiency factor.</p>

<p class="pnr">(a) As an incident to high shop organization and efficient operation, the
standard time required for every job should be scientifically ascertained.</p>

<p class="pnr">(b) To eliminate accidental and unavoidable variations in material, etc.,
the worker is allowed to sum the standard time of all his jobs, gaining
on some, losing on others, averaging closely even.</p>

<p class="pnr">(c) For coöperating with the management in eliminating wastes, the worker
is paid a 20 per cent bonus for the efficiency of 100 per cent, which means,
that the time taken for all his jobs must be equal to the standard times
allowed for all his jobs. If he takes 10 hours on a 1-hour job and 1 hour
on a 10-hour job, his average remains 100 per cent.</p>

<p class="pnr"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p class="pnr">(d) The same work is assumed to be done always in the same standard
manner. Variations from standard are a general charge or credit to
shop efficiency, not a specific variation in cost. A train passenger is
not charged more because his train has been delayed by a snowstorm,
or less because a fair wind and a clear track made the particular
train run less costly than usual.</p>

<p class="p1">Under the efficiency system the worker is entitled to standard day
rates, even if he is doing nothing. If, however, by reason of special individual
effort or skill, he does his work faster, he is entitled, not to a part (one-third
or one-half, as in the Halsey system), but he is entitled to be paid in full for
all the time he saves. As he has not less coöperated with the management,
he is, in addition, entitled to 20 per cent bonus for all the time he works.</p>

<p>Therefore, if a worker whose pay is $0.25 per hour delivers 300 hours
of jobs in a month of 250 working hours, he receives:</p></div>

<div class="reduct">

<p>If, however, the worker does not so coöperate with the management
as to make the shop operate at high efficiency, himself included, he does not
receive as much extra pay, but a lessening amount until at 67 per cent and
below he is paid day rate and no more.</p>

<p>The diagram shows plainly the efficiency wage line beginning at 6
hours, showing 20 per cent increase at 4 hours, standard time, and paying 4
hours time even if the work took no time at all&mdash;a condition that arises practically
quite often, as when a worker runs two jobs at the same time, or when
he does work on his own time.</p>

<p>While the diagram can be applied to a 4-hour job, the worker is not
paid by the separate job, but is paid straight day wages and a bonus for his
full-pay period efficiency. For each per cent of efficiency there is a corresponding
increase in pay.</p>

<p>For 100 per cent efficiency the increase is 20 per cent, and for each 1
per cent increase in efficiency above an efficiency of 100 per cent, the pay also
increases 1 per cent; therefore, for 120 per cent efficiency the pay is increased
40 per cent. Below 100 per cent the pay table runs as follows:</p></div>

<div class="reduct">

<p>The system has other merits:</p>

<p class="pnr">(1) It standardizes not only the work of each worker, but also of every foreman,
every department, and of the shop as a whole.</p>

<p class="pnr"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p class="pnr">(2) It therefore standardizes the shop cost of every job, whether it is done
by a cheap apprentice in two hours, or a high priced mechanic in 10
hours. The average shop or department efficiency factor equalizes accidental
variations.</p>

<p class="pnr">(3) It separates absolutely all questions of wage rate from questions of output,
shop conditions, or individual excellence.</p>

<p class="pnr">(4) It fines the management heavily if shop conditions are not maintained
so as to realize standard times.</p>

<p class="pnr">(5) It puts no limit on the ambition or earning power of any man.</p>

<p class="pnr">(6) Standard times are being constantly corrected. If the standard man
cannot average 100 per cent on his schedules, it is evident that some of
them are too short and ought to be lengthened. If on the other hand,
a new machine tool is introduced, new schedules are drawn up for it,
but the worker will not, on that account, make less than he did on the
old schedule.</p>

<p class="p1">It is too much to expect that any system of paying wages will prevent
an outbreak of selfish interests whether of employer or wage earner. There
will, however, be a distinct gain if the nature of the disagreement can be made
entirely distinct and plain. Clear thinking must precede clear acting, and
this description of different wage systems may contribute towards clearer
conceptions and more just practice.</p></div>

<p class="p1">To establish a modern wage system, standard times must be
determined on a scientific basis, and the rate must not only be equitable
as between employer and employe, but, as Mr. Bender has said,
"it must hit the men right." Shop conditions must be right and
every facility given the workmen to attain standard time or better,
including teaching him how to do the work in standard time. The
<i>speeder</i> or <i>task setter</i> employed under the day-wage plan must be
superseded by the <i>instructor</i>, who, instead of selecting the most
speedy worker and basing standard times on his operations, first
determines as closely as possible what the time should be, and then
teaches his men how to attain that time. Where stop-watch methods
foster discontent and breed antagonism, instruction is followed by
coöperation. The average man does not object to doing a task in
a stated time when he is given the facilities for doing the work that
will make that a reasonable time. Add to this the incentive of extra
pay for equaling or bettering that time, and his coöperation is
insured.</p>

<h3 class="p2">METHODS OF TIME KEEPING</h3>

<p><b>6.</b> Time keeping may be divided into two classes. The first
class includes methods of recording the total time that the employe
works during a pay-roll period. The second class includes methods
of recording the results of the labor of each employe&mdash;the quantity
produced, expressed in the units adopted by the trade in which he
is employed.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>


<p>Ordinarily, trading concerns require records of the first class
only, the pay of the employe being based on the time spent, rather
than on the quantity of his production. This is because of established
custom and the difficulty of measuring his production. Primarily,
the pay of the employe is based on his efficiency, but it is not
always practical to attempt to reduce the results of that efficiency
to standard units.</p>

<p>Manufacturers require records of both classes. Not only is
it necessary to know how many hours each employe has worked,
but the quantity of production must be known.</p>

<p>It is true that a manufacturing business requires the services
of some employes whose productiveness is not readily expressed in
standard units, in which cases the first method only can be used.
These are the men who are necessary to the economical operation
of a department or shop, or of the plant as a whole, but whose time
cannot be charged to a particular job. Labor of this class is termed
<i>indirect</i> or <i>non-productive</i>.</p>

<p>The labor of most employes in a manufacturing plant is applied
directly to the production of specific articles, or to the completion
of certain definite jobs. This makes it possible to reduce the results
of their labor to definite units. Labor of this class is termed <i>direct</i>
or <i>productive</i>.</p>

<p>Records of production, as well as records of time, are necessary
for two reasons. First, when the piece rate or the more modern
premium system is used, employes are paid according to the number
of units produced. Second, to obtain accurate records of costs, it
is necessary to have accurate records of production.</p>

<p>For the purpose of determining the amount of wages due the
piece worker, time records are not needed; records of production
supply the information required. But to determine the actual labor
cost per unit, time records are needed even in the case of piece workers.
Piece rates are based on continuous production at a uniform rate.
A marked falling off in production means a perceptible increase in
the cost per unit for overhead expense. For example, we will suppose
that a manufacturer has $50,000.00 invested in machines operated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
by piece workers. One of the definite items of expense to be apportioned
to the product of these machines is interest, at say five or six
per cent. If production falls to one-half of the normal quantity,
because one-half of the machines are idle, the amount of this one
item of expense that must be borne by each unit of production is
doubled. Or, we may have two workers operating identical machines
on the same class of work, the production of one being twice
that of the other. The overhead expense is the same for each employe
and each machine, consequently the cost of the finished product
is affected by the factor of time. The piece worker who fails
to maintain the rate of production established as standard in his or
her trade, is not a profitable worker.</p>

<p><b>7. Time-Keeping Systems.</b> There are several systems or
methods of time keeping in use. No one system is adapted for use
under all conditions. Like all other classes of records, the time-keeping
system must be selected with reference to the conditions under
which it is to be operated. The system used in a factory, where all
operatives are housed in one or more buildings, is not well adapted to
the needs of a contractor whose men may be working on jobs located
at points widely separated.</p>

<p>In this discussion, we will consider first the systems used to
record the total time employed. This will be followed with descriptions
of systems for obtaining records of production.</p>

<p><b>8. Time Book and Check Systems.</b> Of the time-keeping systems
that have been at some time considered standard, the oldest is
the time book kept by the time-keeper. This system required the
time-keeper to identify each man at work, and to record, opposite
his name in the time book, the number of hours worked each day.
Sometimes a special time-keeper was employed, or the foreman
might keep the time book for his own men, the time books of all
foremen being turned in for the purpose of making up the pay-roll.
A system so dependent on the memory of one man never could become
satisfactory.</p>

<p>With the object in view of doing away with the mistakes that
were continually being made in the operation of the time-book system,
the check system was introduced. This was probably the first
attempt at automatic time recording.</p>

<p>Under the check system, each man is assigned a number and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
given a brass check on which his number is stamped. In entering
the works the men are required to pass in front of the time-keeper's
office and to hand in their checks. The time-keeper has, in his
office, a large board with hooks numbered to correspond with the
check numbers. As the checks are handed in they are hung in their
proper places on this board. The checks on the board show what
men are in the works, and from them the necessary entries are
made in the time books.</p>

<p>When the men pass out at noon their checks are handed to
them. Every man must pass out and take his check; otherwise he
will not receive credit for the half-day's time.</p>

<p>The system does not prove entirely satisfactory for several
reasons. It is not exact, for no accurate record of the time a man
enters is possible. Usually the time-keeper's window is closed at
starting time and opened fifteen minutes later to take care of the
late arrivals. Thus the man who is one minute late pays the
same penalty in lost time as the man who comes in fifteen minutes
after the whistle blows. As a natural result, when a man finds
that he cannot reach the works on time he takes the full fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p>While the handing in of a check furnishes reasonable proof that
the man has entered the works, it furnishes no proof that he is at
his work. Many a man has turned in his check in the morning,
left the works by another exit, returned a few minutes before noon,
received his check and full pay for the half day.</p>

<p>In some manufacturing plants where the check system is still
used, this difficulty has been overcome to a certain extent. The
operation of the system is reversed, the men receiving their checks
from the time-keeper as they enter the works. In the shops there
are check boards on which the men hang their checks. These
boards are hinged and provided with locks, the keys being carried
by the foremen. Five minutes after starting time the boards are
locked, and late arrivals are required to turn in their checks to the
foreman who makes records of the time of arrival. Once during
each working period, the time-keeper makes the rounds of the shops
and takes the time records in his time book. At the quitting hour
the boards are unlocked, the men take their checks as they pass out,
and turn them in at the time-keeper's office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p><b>9. Time Clocks.</b> The modern system of time recording makes
use of a time clock or mechanical recorder. Instead of trusting to
the accuracy of a time-keeper, or depending on the workmen to keep
records of their own time, the modern recorder automatically records
the time of arrival and departure of every employe.</p>

<p>Mechanical time recorders, or time clocks, are of two general
types, making two classes of records. One type records the time of
one employe on a single card or sheet; the other makes a record of
the time of several employes on the same sheet. For recording the
total time of employes, both types are used, and certain advantages
are claimed for each.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 5. Rochester Time Recorder,<br />Manufactured by<br />

</div></div>

<p>The records of
the first type, most
generally used, have
a card for each
employe on which
a record is made of
his time for an entire
week or pay
period. In operation,
this system is
very simple.</p>

<p>At each side of
the clock is a card
rack, as shown in
Fig. 5. One of
these is an "out"
rack, the other an "in" rack. At the beginning of each week or pay
period, cards are placed in the numbered pockets of the out rack,
which is nearest the entrance&mdash;one card for each man. These cards
bear the numbers or names of the men, or both if desired.</p>

<p>When the employe enters, he takes his card from the out rack,
places it in the slot of the clock, makes an exact record of the time
of arrival by moving a lever, and places the card in the proper numbered
pocket in the in rack. When he leaves, the operation is repeated,
this time the card being deposited in the out rack. In the
meantime the recording device in the clock has been shifted so that
it records the leaving time in the proper column on the card.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The form of record made by one of the best known clocks of
this type is shown in Fig. 6. It will be noted that the recording device
prints the letter representing the
day of the week in front of each record&mdash;out
or in. Another feature is the
dash under the afternoon registrations;
a glance shows whether the registration
was made at, for instance, 6 o'clock
in the morning or afternoon.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-092a.jpg" width="200" height="289"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 6. Weekly Time<br /> Pay Card Used
in the<br />Rochester Recorder</p>
</div></div>

<p>This form requires an exceptionally
small number of entries to figure the
time for the week. In the outside
column, at the right, is entered the
time lost or the overtime for each day.
At the end of the week, the net total of
this column is added to or subtracted
from the total hours representing a full
week, which gives the total number of
hours actually worked.</p>

<p>Clocks of the second type record the time of several employes
on one sheet, the record being made for one day, or for any number
of days up to a week. Like the card machine, the record shows the
in and out time, both forenoon and afternoon.</p>

<p>A recorder of this
type is illustrated by
Fig. 7. To register
the time of arrival or
departure, the employe
places a key, bearing
his number, in
the clock, and gives
it one turn. A bell
rings, indicating
that the hour and
minute of the day
have been printed on
the record inside the
register.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The form of record made by machines of this type is shown
in Fig. 8. The records of all employes appear in numerical order
on one sheet, with the various <i>ins</i> and <i>outs</i> in their proper columns.
The record is inside the clock, under lock and key, and when removed
can be used as a pay-roll sheet.</p>

<p>The fact that the complete record is on one sheet, is one of the
advantages claimed for this type of recorders. On the other hand,
an advantage is claimed for the card machine in the fact that the
cards can be used for other purposes, such as for cost records.</p>

<h3 class="p2">PRODUCTION TIME RECORDS</h3>

<p><b>10.</b> All records of time on individual jobs or operations may
be termed <i>production time records</i>, since the ultimate object of
keeping such records is to determine the cost of production. To
the manufacturer, these records are fully as important as those showing
the total time worked by each employe. Without such records,
a satisfactory cost system is impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>When the importance of obtaining costs of production&mdash;knowing
what it costs to manufacture a given article&mdash;began to receive consideration,
systems for recording the time spent by the worker on each
job were attempted. There being no other method available, the
records were at first made on cards or slips by the employes themselves.
In all essential features the same system is still largely used; nearly
all cost systems require that the employe keep a record of the time
worked on each job.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 10. Daily Record of the Time of One Man</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>11. Time Record on Work Orders.</b> One method of keeping
time on individual jobs is to make the record on the work order.
When a job is assigned to a workman, a written order is issued to him.
This order, Fig. 9, instructs him to do certain work and gives him
authority to draw the necessary material, provided the material is
not issued with the order. He is instructed to report his time on the
order, and sometimes to report the material used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>This form can be used successfully only when one man does
the entire job. It is used principally for repair jobs.</p>

<p><b>12. Daily Time Card.</b> One of the methods of obtaining production
time records is to use daily time cards. Each employe is
supplied with cards, similar in form to Fig. 10, on which he is expected
to record his time for an entire day.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-096.jpg" width="400" height="350"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 11. Daily Time Card for Machine Operations</p>
</div></div>

<p>At the top, the card bears the name and number of the employe,
and the date. Below the heading, a form is arranged for a record
of the order numbers on which he is employed, a description of the
work done (usually the name of the operation), the time of starting
and finishing, and total time worked on each job.</p>

<p>In some classes of operations it is necessary, if accurate cost
records are to be obtained, to keep a record of performance of the machine,
as well as of the man. A form for a record of this kind, covering
the operation for a day, is illustrated by Fig. 11. This form includes
the number of the machine and a record of the number of pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
produced. Such a record is used for machine operations when a
large number of similar pieces are operated on by a single machine.
The time record is made when one order number is finished and a
new one started. The form shown provides for an extension of rates
and amounts, the extensions being made in the cost department.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-097.jpg" width="250" height="295"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 12. Coupon Time Card<br />for a Day's Operations</p>
</div></div>

<p>Fig. 12 is a card for recording a day's operations, arranged on
somewhat different lines. This card is a series of perforated coupons,
one for each job
on which the employe
works.
When a job is
finished, the
record is made,
the coupon detached
and
turned in. At
the close of the
day the top of
the card, with all
unused coupons
attached, is
turned in.</p>

<p>All of these
forms for recording
the time of
an employe for
an entire day are
handed to the
foreman, who
turns them in to the cost department. Here, the time cards are
compared with the clock records to find if all of the time for which
an employe is paid has been accounted for. The time records for
individual jobs are then transferred to the cost records. For the
latter purpose, the coupons can be distributed by order numbers.
This makes it convenient to retain all time coupons until the job is
finished, when the amounts can be transferred to the cost records
with a considerable saving of labor in the cost department.</p>

<p>There is one serious objection to any form of time card designed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
for a day's record. Too much depends upon the accuracy and
clerical ability of the employe. The average factory or shop operative
has had no experience in keeping records. He does not appreciate
the importance of the time records he is expected to keep, and,
naturally, becomes careless. Knowing that a record is expected,
his card will show full time, but the distribution of that time to separate
jobs is not accurate. Frequently, he waits until the close of the day
and makes as close a guess as possible as to the time worked on each
job. His failure to keep accurate records is not due to unwillingness,
but to his lack of training in such work.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-098.jpg" width="400" height="249"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 13. Job Card with Time Chart</p>
</div></div>

<p>Exceptions are found, as a matter of course, and in some industries
the general character of the operatives employed is such as
to practically insure intelligent record keeping. As a rule, however,
it is unwise to expect the factory employe to keep accurate records.</p>

<p><b>13. Job Time Cards.</b> A method of time keeping which is an
advance over the daily time card, is the use of a separate card for
each job. With this method, accuracy of the records can be practically
insured and the employe relieved of much of the clerical labor.</p>

<p>To attain satisfactory results, it is necessary to operate this
system along somewhat different lines than that described for the
daily time card system. Instead of issuing cards for the entire day,
the workman should be given a new card with each new job on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
which he works, and not until he has completed the job last worked
on. The time must be recorded and the card turned in to the foreman
on completion of each job.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the foreman to keep his men supplied with work,
and to have at all times a job ahead. The workmen, knowing that
a record of his time on each job is kept and compared with the clock
record, will naturally insist on having a new job card when each old
one is turned in. If no job is ready, it will be necessary for the foreman
to issue an <i>idle</i> or <i>non-productive</i> card&mdash;a condition which he
will strive to avoid&mdash;all such time becoming a direct expense charge
against his department.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-099.jpg" width="400" height="252"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 14. Job Card Showing Names of Operations</p>
</div></div>

<p>To relieve the employe of clerical labor, a card, similar in form
to Fig. 13, is used with quite satisfactory results. The special feature
of this card is the provision made for obtaining a record of time. Below
the heading there is a form representing the time of day, each
hour being divided into ten minute periods, and the whole divided
between forenoon and afternoon.</p>

<p>When a new job is started, the workman makes the record by
checking the time in the proper space. On completion of the job,
he makes a similar check mark in the space that indicates the finishing
time. The exact time is computed in the cost department.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
To illustrate: Suppose a job is started at 7 A. M. and is done in 6½
hours. The time will be checked at 7 A. M. and again, if an hour
is allowed for lunch, at 2:30 P. M. This really shows 7½ hours
elapsed time, but in the cost department, the lunch hour will be
allowed for, and the computed time will be correct.</p>

<p>Another form of job card, intended for use where jobs require
more than one day, is shown in Fig. 14. With this card, it is intended
that the starting and finishing time shall be entered in the
ordinary way, and the name of the operation checked.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>14. Mechanical Time Recorders.</b> For the same reasons that
they are best for making records of total time, for pay-roll purposes,
mechanical time recorders are best for obtaining production time
records. Whether the responsibility of making the record rests
on the workman or a clerk, it is always better to have the actual
recording done automatically whenever it is possible to do so.</p>

<p>While the time recorders used for keeping total time are also
used for obtaining production time records, there are certain advantages
in using recorders of slightly different types. Manufacturers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
have made great progress and are now supplying machines which
answer every requirement.</p>

<p>One type of recorder designed for production time records is
shown in Fig. 15. This outfit includes, in addition to the recorder,
a rack for jobs ahead and jobs started, a rack for finished jobs, and
a distribution rack. The first rack contains pockets of the right size
to hold time cards or tickets. These pockets are numbered to correspond
with the men's numbers, two pockets being provided for
each man, one for jobs ahead and one for jobs started. The rack
for finished jobs is divided into compartments bearing the men's
numbers, with slots through which the cards are inserted. The distribution
rack is divided into compartments numbered for the
different jobs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-101.jpg" width="400" height="172"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 16. Individual Job Card Used with the Day Time Register</p>
</div></div>

<p>The recorder and card racks are placed near the foreman's
desk, which should be at a central point in the department. The
foreman prepares cards for the different employes and places a card
for the next job in the <i>jobs ahead</i> pocket. The workman, when
starting to work, takes the card for the next job, records the starting
time, and places the card in the <i>jobs started</i> pocket. When the job
is finished he again records the time, on the same card, and places
the card in the compartment bearing his number in the <i>finished jobs</i>
rack. At night, if he has an unfinished job, he records the time, the
same as for a finished job, and either turns in the card to the foreman
or places it in a box kept for suspended jobs. The foreman then
makes out new cards and places them in the <i>jobs ahead</i> rack, while
the suspended card is placed in the <i>finished jobs</i> rack.</p>

<p>Every morning all cards of the previous day are taken from
the <i>finished jobs</i> rack, the time recorded on each man's cards is computed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and compared with the record of the total time recorder, and
the cards distributed by job numbers in the distribution rack. This
checks the job time with the pay-roll time, and permits of leaving
the cards in the distribution rack until the entire job is finished.
The cards are then taken to the cost department and the time records
distributed on the cost sheet.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>One form of card used with this type of recorder is shown in
Fig. 16. One card is used for each job on which a man works.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
It will be noted that the time is recorded in decimals. Instead of
the usual 12 hours, the recording wheel is divided into 24-hour periods,
or if desired, into 23 hours, automatically eliminating the noon hour.
The 23-hour wheel prints 12 at noon and again at one o'clock, 13
at two o'clock, etc. At 3:30 P. M., for instance, the clock would
record 14.50, meaning 14½ hours. On the card illustrated, the record
shows the job to have been started at 8.08 and finished at 11.40,
the elapsed time being 3.32 hours.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 18. The Calculagraph,<br />Manufactured by the<br />Calculagraph Company</p>
</div></div>

<p>A clock of similar type accommodates a sheet of any size, and
provides for as many separate time records on the same sheet as
may be desired. A sheet may
record the time of a single employe
for an entire day and show
the exact time worked on each
job. Or, in some industries, the
card may be made for a job and
arranged to accumulate the time
of all employes working on the
job. Fig. 17 shows how several
time sheets of this class can be
bound together, making a daily
time and pay sheet for each employe.
From this sheet the time
is distributed to the cost sheets.</p>

<p>Still another type of time recorder,
which offers certain distinct advantages, is shown in Fig. 18.
This machine is used to obtain a time record for each employe on
each separate job or operation.</p>

<p>The distinctive feature of this machine is that it records the elapsed
time. When a man commences work on a new job, he places his card
in the machine and by moving a lever registers the starting time.
When the job is finished, he again places the card in the machine, this
time moving a second lever, and registers the exact time that he has
worked on the job. The advantage is apparent. With an ordinary
time stamp printing the starting and finishing time, it is necessary for
a clerk to mentally compute the elapsed time. With this machine the
elapsed time is mechanically computed and printed, saving the time
of the clerks and doing away with all possibility of clerical errors.</p>

<p>The machine is made to register either hours and minutes, or
hours and tenths of hours. For cost-keeping purposes the latter
is preferred for the reason that it is much easier to figure time at a
given rate in tenths.</p>

<p>A form of card, without the record, is shown in Fig. 20. The
card can be of any size desired, the only requirement being a blank
space for the time record in the upper left-hand corner.</p>

<p>As with other recorders, one of these machines should be located
at a central point in each department. It is advisable to provide a
card rack with compartments bearing the employe's numbers, and
to place cards for jobs ahead in these compartments. The cards
for the day are first sorted by employe's numbers to verify the clock
record, and then by job numbers for the use of the cost department.</p>

<p>Another elapsed time recorder, which was placed on the market
after the above was put in type, but before this book went to press,
is shown in Fig. 21, the form of record being shown in Fig. 22.</p>

<p>The device is operated electrically, the impulses being furnished
by a master clock. This may be located anywhere in the building,
preferably in the office, as it will be less affected by vibration and
dust. To the master clock is also fitted the 24-hour elimination or
cut-out wheel described later. This clock transmits electric impulses
each minute all through the building to the various elapsed time mechanisms.
Thus all the machines are exactly the same time and cards
may be registered in on one machine and out on any other and correct
results obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>The mechanism is
about nine inches square
and is enclosed in a dust
proof iron case. It may
be placed on a work
bench, on a pedestal, or
it may be sunk flush with
the top of the bench or
desk. The flat cover has
two openings or slots for
the insertion of the cards.
One opening is marked
"in" for the first record
of a job, the other "out"
for registering when the
job is completed. There
is also an aperture in the
cover through which may
be seen a series of indicating
wheels showing exactly the time of day. There is only one
handle to be operated and, therefore, no confusion can occur in the
mind of the operator as to
which handle to pull.</p>

<div class="floatright">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 22. Time Card Used with<br /> the International<br />
Elapsed Time Recorder</p>
</div></div>

<p>The cards used in the
machine may be of any
length desired but can only
be of one width, 4¼ inches.
In registering in, the card is
placed in the front or starting
slot, and the lever pulled
over. This prints the starting
time at the top of the
card in the space to the left.
At the same time four small
holes are punched in the
card which individualize the
record. After a job is completed
the card is placed in
the rear or stopping slot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the lever pulled over once more, and the stopping time and actual
elapsed time are both printed on the card by one pull of the handle,
thus enabling anyone to compare the two records and prove the
accuracy of the machine for every record.</p>

<p>One of the salient features connected with this device is its
ability to compute only the actual time worked in the factory irrespective
of the times of registration. That is to say, in a factory working
ten hours a day from seven to twelve and one to six the elapsed time
will only be computed during these hours. Any registrations made
before seven o'clock will not begin to count elapsed time until that
hour, and the computation of elapsed time automatically stops at
noon to be resumed at exactly one o'clock, and then continues until
quitting time at night, when again it stops automatically. The clock
movement, however, does not stop, but always shows the correct time
exactly the same as the master clock, and is entirely unaffected by the
elimination of the non-working hours in figuring the elapsed time.
The machine can also be set to record overtime at night if so desired.</p>

<p>In case work on a given job is not completed on the day it is
begun, it is not necessary to ring out on the elapsed time machine
until the job is completed as the machine computes up to 100 hours.
A job beginning on Monday and running through the week until
Saturday night, when it is finished, may be registered on one card, or
even for a longer period up to 100 hours.</p>

<p>The elimination or cut-out wheel referred to as being a part of
the master clock, is responsible for this wonderful piece of work.
The wheel makes one revolution in twenty-four hours and is graduated
in fifteen minute divisions for the purpose of setting the contact
breakers. The contact breakers are bits of hard rubber which are
fastened around the rim of the wheel, and may be moved about at the
will of the custodian of the apparatus by simply loosening the set
screw. These blocks are set on the starting and stopping time and
when they pass the contact breakers the electrical circuit is broken,
and the computing device started or stopped as the case may be.</p>

<p><b>15. Cumulative Time Records.</b> In some factories and shops,
the work is of such nature that economy results if the work order
and the time record follows the job through all of the operations.
For example, hosiery and underwear go through the factory in dozen
lots; in a shoe factory a lot of shoes is kept together until every operation
is finished; in a harness factory, a bridle goes through all operations
on one work order; in a machine shop, one or more rough castings
may pass through several operations in the process of converting
them into finished parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>When these conditions exist, it is practical to attach a time card
to the work, and to accumulate the time of all employes for the entire
job. At the same time, individual time records are obtained.</p>

<p>A form to be used with the mechanical time recorder, Fig. 18,
is shown in Fig. 23. This form consists of the usual work order
to which is attached a series of coupons, perforated for easy removal.
Each coupon is of the right size to accommodate the time record,
and particulars as to the order number, operation number, man's
number, and number of pieces.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 25. Operations Tag Used<br /> in an Underwear Mill</p>
</div></div>

<p>The man who has the first operation enters his number and
records his starting time on the first coupon. When the operation
is finished, the time employed is recorded, the coupon is detached,
and the job goes forward to the next operator. If the operation is
not finished at the close of the day, the time record is made and the
next coupon used by the same operator.</p>

<p>Each day, all of the detached coupons are sent to the cost department,
where they serve several purposes. They are first sorted
by employes' numbers, to compare the time reported with the clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
record; then sorted by job numbers, to
obtain time records for each job. From
the coupons, all necessary information is
obtained for a record of jobs in process,
showing just where each job is at all times.</p>

<p>Another form for a cumulative, as well
as an individual time record, is shown in
Fig. 24. This card is for use where no
time recorders are provided. Each employe
records his time, and, when the last
operation is finished, the card goes to the
cost department. If desired, this card
might be made with detachable coupons
for the different operations.</p>

<h3 class="p2">PIECE-WORK RECORDS</h3>

<p><b>16.</b> Where piece-rate or premium
wage systems are in effect, is it necessary
to have accurate records of production,
since the pay of the worker is governed
by the number of units of production.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
It has already been stated, that to obtain the exact cost per unit of
production, time records must be kept on piece work. It is not,
however, absolutely necessary that the time be recorded for each
separate job or unit of production. The necessary requirement is
that the production records shall be so kept that they can be checked
as to time&mdash;that the time required for a given number of units of production
can be obtained, or that the units of production during a
stated time can be definitely known.</p>

<p>Piece rates are applied to many distinct classes of work, each of
which necessitates a slightly different system of records. One of
the industries in which piece rates are largely used, is the manufacture
of garments of different classes. In this industry, each garment
or lot of garments passes through several operations, each operation
being performed by a different operator. Since practically all
operations are on a piece-rate basis, it is necessary to obtain a record
of the name or number of each operator.</p>

<p>A form for a record of operations in an underwear mill is shown
in Fig. 25. This is in the form of a shipping tag with particulars
of the order at the top, followed by a list of the operations. As fast
as the goods are cut, they are tied in bundles of one dozen garments.
The tag is then attached, the cutters' names or numbers are entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>

to a storeroom located conveniently to the machines.</p>

<p>In the mill where this particular system is in operation, each

as needed&mdash;always writing her name on the tag. When the work is
received in the storeroom, a clerk records the last operation on the
operator's time card, Fig. 26. One of these cards is used for each
operator and accommodates the record of work for an entire week.
Provision is made in the column at the left for a record of the kind
of work, while the record of dozens finished each day is shown in
the proper daily columns. At the end of the week, when extensions
have been made, this card shows the amount of wages due, the different
kinds of work done, and the quantities finished. In connection
with this, the usual clock record of total time is kept, and a
comparison of the piece work and clock records will show whether
or not the operator is maintaining standard time on the different
classes of work.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of certain classes of cans, some of the operations
are paid for on a piece-rate basis; but payment is made on the
basis of the production of a crew. The operation of crimping tin
ends on certain cans, requires a crimper and several helpers, the
latter preparing the cans for the operation. For this operation, the
pay of all members of the crew is based on the number of cans finished;
that is, if the number finished by a crew consisting of one
crimper and four helpers is 2,000, the crimper will be paid for that
number, while the helpers will each be paid for 500. The form used
for a record of production on this operation is shown in Fig. 27.
This is the assembled record, the individual time records being made
mechanically on a card, Fig. 28.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>On the operation above referred to, the speed of the helpers is
limited to the speed of the machine, but if three helpers instead of
four can do the work, the pay of each will be increased correspondingly.
In the operations handled by crews, there is nothing to limit
production. The result is that each member of the crew is obliged to
maintain the pace set by the most speedy member, which reduces
the cost of production and enables all members of the crew to earn
a higher average wage.</p>

<p>A form of piece-work record, used in a factory where employes are
expected to keep their own time, is shown in Fig. 29. This ticket is filled
in by the employe, <i>O. K.'d</i> by the foreman after inspection of the work,
and forwarded to the cost department. All unfinished piece work is
reported on the form shown in Fig. 30. This report enables the cost
department to determine the actual time of all piece-work operations.</p>

<p>Before piece rates can be established for new work, it is necessary
to ascertain the average time required for the different operations.
This necessitates a very accurate record of production of
employes working on day wage rates, and the record must represent
the average rate of production of all employes, rather than the rate
maintained by a few of the most skillful. A form used in one factory
for such a record is shown in Fig. 31. When new work is started,
one of these cards is filled in for each employe assigned to the work,
and a record kept of each operation. When the records have been
kept for a sufficient length of time to obtain an average, the records
of all employes for the same operation are combined and, on the
average thus obtained, the piece rates are established.</p>

<h3 class="p2">PAYING EMPLOYES</h3>

<p><b>17.</b> The time records of all employes, no matter how kept,
must be assembled for the purpose of making up the pay-roll. Special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
forms of time sheets or pay-roll records are designed to meet the
requirements of different classes of business. Several such forms
are shown in other papers in this series; others are illustrated herein.</p>

<p>A conventional form of time sheet is shown in Fig. 32. The
names are grouped on this sheet by departments, and opposite each
man's name is his number. The daily time records are kept for a
period of one week, then totaled, and the amount of wages extended
in the last column.</p>

<p>Fig. 33 shows a form of time sheet intended for a tabulation
of both the clock record and job time. The bringing together of
the total time records (as shown by the clock) and the production
time records (as shown by the job time cards) is of very great importance
in connection with any system of cost accounting. One
must be checked against the other, for unless all of the time for which
the employe is paid is accounted for in the cost records, cost figures
will be incorrect.</p>

<p>If the two records do not agree, even though the employe is paid
for the time shown by his clock record, the discrepancy should be
adjusted. Theoretically, every minute of a man's time should be
accounted for by his time cards and, when conditions permit, he
should be paid only for the time so accounted for. This rule should
not be so rigidly enforced, however, as to encourage a man in padding
the time on individual jobs to reconcile the total for the day with his
clock record; it is far better to have a few minutes unaccounted for.
When a foreman fails to have work ready, he should give the workman
an idle or indirect labor card, but the man should be impressed
with the fact that accurate records are kept of his time on every job,
and that all lost time must be either reported on an indirect labor
card or left unreported.</p>

<p>The cost of time shown on indirect labor cards, and of all time
unaccounted for, should be charged to the department under some
such caption as <i>Department Waste</i>, never to the specific jobs on which
the man has worked. Time wasted between jobs or on account of
a breakdown or other unusual occurrence does not affect the legitimate
time in which a particular job should be done. It is rather a
legitimate charge against the efficiency of the department, and the
aggregate of all such inefficiency charges should be applied as an
added burden to all of the jobs in the department during the month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Costs obtained, after adding this inefficiency burden, may be
considered the actual costs for the month, but cannot be safely used
as standard. Standard costs are the costs obtained under perfect
conditions&mdash;when the department, shop, or plant is running full
time at full capacity; when all of the time of every employe is accounted
for by his job time cards; when there is no wasted time or
unusual expense. While standard costs may not be attained&mdash;probably
never will be&mdash;this should be the goal, to reach which, managers,
engineers, superintendents, foremen, and workmen should strive
constantly. As a matter of record, therefore, to show what obstacles
must be overcome before the ideal is reached, the inefficiency burden
should be added as a separate item after all other items of cost have
been computed.</p>

<p>As an example of the effect of the application of this principle
of considering efficiency in figuring costs, we will consider an imaginary
case. We will suppose that, in a certain month, the pay-roll
for direct or productive labor in our shop is $4,000; that 40 completed
machines&mdash;identical in every respect&mdash;are produced; that every
minute of the time of every productive employe is accounted for by
his productive job cards. This gives a labor cost of $100 per machine.
During the next month the same men are employed at the
same cost&mdash;$4,000&mdash;but owing to an unusual breakdown, 2½% of the
time of these men is wasted; they are idle while the breakdown is
repaired, and but 39 machines are produced.</p>

<p>If the $4,000 wages paid is charged as direct or productive labor
it gives a cost of $102.56 each&mdash;an increase in cost with nothing in
the figures that shows the cause. If, however, an inefficiency charge
of $100 (2½% of $4,000) or $2.56 per machine is added as a separate
item, it is seen at once that here is an unusual item of expense.
The amount ($2.56 per machine) is included in the final costs, but
in the right place; there is no cause for confusion on account of an
apparent, but not real, increase in the productive labor cost. If
the cost of $100 per machine obtained during the preceding month
is standard for productive labor, it still is the attainable standard;
the fact of an unusual expense has in no way affected the legitimate
cost of productive labor.</p>

<p>Another great advantage in presenting the labor cost statistics
in this manner is that inefficiencies are shown in an understandable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
form. The fact that indirect labor is increased, say 2%, might
occasion no comment; but if an inefficiency charge of even 1% is
shown, it calls for immediate investigation.</p>

<p>The establishment of standard or efficiency labor costs means
predetermined costs. This is a radical departure from established
custom; on its face, contrary to recognized accounting practice;
in results, wonderfully efficient. To determine standards in men,
material, and machines is a function of the engineer; the recording
of facts&mdash;the actual cost&mdash;is the function of the comptroller or accountant.
The two must work together. Properly prepared accounts,
showing actual costs with the items that make them segregated, show
the engineer how far short of possible standards the plant is running&mdash;the
extent of the inefficiency.</p>

establishments, the employment department will keep these records.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>19. Application Card.</b> Fig. 34 shows a simple form of application
card to be filled out for every applicant who is not hired immediately,
but whose application receives favorable consideration. This
card is headed with the name of the position applied for, or the trade
of the applicant. Following this is the name and address, and such
information about the applicant as may be considered of special value.</p>

<p>These cards are filed in a regulation card index drawer and
indexed under the trade or position applied for. The index cards
are headed with the names of the trades employed, the departments,
or such other designations as may be best suited to the business.
For instance, one index might be headed <i>Machinists</i>. Back of this
index the cards of all applicants for positions as machinists will be
filed in alphabetical order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>A form of application card which provides for more detailed
information along certain lines is shown in Fig. 35. While this
card is headed with the name of the employe, it is filed under the
trade, as described for Fig. 34.</p>

<p>The value of these application records is apparent. When a
man is needed, reference to this file will show who has applied and
assist in getting a man quickly.</p>

<p><b>20. Employe's Card.</b> One form of employe's card is illustrated
by Fig. 36. This card is filed as soon as a man is engaged. At the
head of the card is the name of the employe, the department to which
he is assigned, and his clock number. Following this is the address
and other essential information. Space is also provided for a record
of changes in wages, including both dates and rates. At the bottom
of the card, space is left for notes on the record of the employe, which
can be continued on the back of the card. The final record on this
card is the date the employe quits, or is discharged, with reasons.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 38. Card Record of a Past Employe</p>
</div></div>

<p>Another form of employe's card is shown in Fig. 37. The
special feature of this card is that, for each increase in wages, the
reason and name of the person granting the increase is noted.</p>

<p>The cards of present employes are filed alphabetically by name.
However, in very large establishments, it is advisable to subdivide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
them by departments and arrange the cards of all employes in the
department in alphabetical order. It is seldom necessary to arrange
the cards by trades for the reason that the names are, as a rule, so
classified on the pay-roll records.</p>

<p>The employe's record proves valuable in many ways. If, for any
reason, an employe is away from his work, and it is desired to communicate
with him, the address is quickly found; in case of an accident, resulting
in injury to the employe, the address is very convenient. Again,
when a man is wanted for a position a little above that occupied by
the average employe, it is best, if possible, to select a man from the
present employes. Whether the position be that of a gang boss, a foreman,
or the head of a department, a condensed record of past performance,
supplementing the personal observations of his superiors,
will be found of considerable assistance in selecting the right man.
Many other advantages might be named, but those given should be
sufficient to demonstrate the advisability of maintaining these records.</p>

<p><b>21. Past Employe's Card.</b> In some respects, a record of past
employes is as important as the record of applicants and present
employes. When more men are needed, it is natural to suppose
that past employes, whose services were satisfactory, will be specially
desirable. On the contrary, a past employe who has been discharged,
or whose work was unsatisfactory, is unlikely to be desirable.</p>

<p>Any record that will show who the past employes are, why they
left, and their past record, will therefore be of value. Such a record
is provided by the card illustrated in Fig. 38. When an employe
leaves, for any reason, one of these cards is filled in and filed alphabetically.
At the same time, the employe's card is transferred to
another section of the file, and indexed under the name of the department,
or the trade or class of employment.</p>

<p>These cards furnish a very complete record of employes, past,
present, and future. If the number is small, all can be filed in one
drawer, with separate indexes to segregate them into classes. Or
a large cabinet, with one or more drawers for each class of records,
may be required, but, in any event, the records are complete.</p>

<h3 class="p2">MANUFACTURING ORDERS</h3>

<p><b>22.</b> One of the principles that must be kept in mind when installing
a system of any description is that provision must be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
for recording every detail of the work intended to be cared for by
the system. While this holds true in respect to the systems in every
other department of a business, it is of special importance in the
manufacturing branch. Accurate costs are out of the question unless
every detail of the operations of the plant is properly recorded.</p>

<p>Experience has shown but one method that will insure accurate
records, and that method is to manufacture all goods on definite
orders and to charge all work not applied to a specific manufacturing
order, to expense or operating accounts. The receipt of an order
to manufacture before starting the work, is of the same importance
to the superintendent as that the commercial department shall receive
an order from the customer before shipping goods.</p>

<p>Few managers will accept verbal orders for the manufacture of
expensive goods, without asking for a confirmation in writing. When
those orders are transmitted to the manufacturing department, it
is just as important that they shall be in writing.</p>

<p>Manufacturing orders are of two classes: general orders to the
superintendent to manufacture a certain quantity of goods, and
specific orders to shop foremen to do some part of the work. For
convenience, these orders will be referred to in this discussion as
<i>Production</i> orders and <i>Shop</i> orders.</p>

<p><b>23. Production Orders.</b> The production order is the written
instructions to the superintendent to manufacture certain goods.
It is his authority to secure the necessary material, to employ the
required number of men, and to convert that material and labor into
the finished product. The production order may call for the manufacture
of the quantity of goods of a certain type required to fill
one or more customers' orders; the manufacture of a certain quantity
of goods to be placed in stock, from which to fill future orders; the
conversion of a definite quantity of raw material into finished products;
or even the manufacture of an indefinite quantity of raw material
into an equally indefinite quantity of the finished product, but within
a definite period of time.</p>

<p>Usually the production orders of one factory will be confined
to one class, though there are some exceptions. In the first
class, we find shops manufacturing special machinery, jobbing
foundries, and mills manufacturing underwear and hosiery. In the
latter business the goods are sold in advance, from samples, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
only the quantities or particular styles required to fill orders are
manufactured.</p>

<p>The second class includes furniture factories, typewriter factories,
the manufacture of tools, and numberless similar industries
in which a stock of standard goods is manufactured for future sale.</p>

<p>An example of the third class is found in a harness factory.
In this business, a certain number of sides of leather are issued to
the cutting room to be cut. Since the leather is not uniform in
weight or texture, it is not possible to cut an entire side of leather
into pieces of the same size, or the same parts of a harness&mdash;as lines
or traces. The cutter must use his best judgment, so cutting the
leather that it will produce the largest possible volume of usable
stock, with the least waste. The definite factor is the side of leather
which is to be converted into an indefinite quantity of finished, or
semi-finished product.</p>

<p>The last class is illustrated in the manufacture of salt. The
brine&mdash;raw material&mdash;is pumped from the wells into storage tanks,
from which it is drawn into evaporating pans or grainers. An order
may be issued to make what is known as <i>common fine salt</i> in three of
these evaporators. Evaporating processes are influenced by atmospheric
conditions&mdash;the same heat will evaporate the brine much more
rapidly one day than another. Also, the brine is of different degrees
of strength&mdash;the same quantity does not always contain the same
amount of salt. The only definite factor is time&mdash;an indefinite quantity
of brine is converted, in a given time, into an indefinite quantity
of salt and, it might be added, of an indefinite quality.</p>

<p>When all these conditions are considered, together with the fact
that each manufacturer has his individual methods of conducting
the business&mdash;methods probably different from those of his competitors
in the same line&mdash;it will be seen that the variety of forms of
production orders is almost without number. But the important
thing is to have an order of some kind&mdash;to provide a record.</p>

<p>If there is one essential feature to be incorporated in the production
order, it can be expressed in two words&mdash;definite instructions.
The order should be made perfectly clear, leaving no room for doubt,
as to what is desired. When No. 3 dining-room chairs are wanted,
the order should state the fact very clearly, and not read <i>chairs</i>, leaving
the superintendent to guess the style and size.</p>

<p>The form of the production order need not be complicated;
indeed, a simple form will serve the purpose much better, an illustration
of which is shown in Fig. 39. The heading of this order
shows the number and date, with instructions to the superintendent
to carry out the work as specified. The body of the order is blank,
providing space for entering such details as may be necessary. The
blank at the bottom, which is filled in by the superintendent's clerk,
shows the date received, date started, the shop order number, and
the date finished.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 41. Sub-production or Shop Order</p>
</div></div>

<p>This form is suitable for almost any kind of business or class
of order. The production order should always be made in duplicate,
a copy to be kept in the office. The office copy will be used to follow
up the manufacturing order.</p>

<p>In many lines of business, goods are manufactured only as
required to fill customers' orders. The order to manufacture should,
in such cases, be an exact copy of the customer's order as entered.
With the modern method of entering all orders in manifold&mdash;with
a copy for each record required&mdash;one blank should be included for
the factory, this becoming the production order. A form of this
kind is shown in Fig. 40. This is an exact copy of the order as entered,
the instructions in the heading taking the place of the name and
address of the manufacturer. The particulars include the number,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
date received, and date to be shipped. The body of the order contains
the necessary instructions; in the column at the extreme left&mdash;quantity
ordered, quantity shipped, size, and description. This is
one of a set of blanks that include the invoice, office copy, cost department
copy, and copy for the shipping department.</p>

<p><b>24. Shop Orders.</b> The shop order is the written instruction
of the superintendent to the foreman to do certain work or to manufacture
certain articles. The order may call for the manufacture
of a certain article complete, or it may be for parts to be later assembled
into a complete article. Shop orders are as varied in form as production
orders.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 42. Shop Order Showing Total Work Cards</p>
</div></div>

<p>When a superintendent desires to start work on a stated production
order, he lays out the work and issues the necessary shop
orders to the foremen of the different departments in which the work
is to be done. A shop order is issued for each shop&mdash;usually these
are exact copies. If work on an order requires work to be done in
four shops, the four copies are made on the typewriter, at one writing,
by means of carbon paper.</p>

<p>Fig. 41 shows a convenient form of shop order. This form
includes the shop order number, piece number, drawing number,
material, date to be completed, date of order, production order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
number on which the shop order applies, and the date completed.
The body of the order is left blank for a description of the work
and the necessary instructions. Explicit instructions must be
given on every shop order&mdash;the order should leave nothing for granted.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 44. Shop Order Showing Progress of the Work</p>
</div></div>

<p>The special feature of the shop order shown in Fig. 42 is the
space for <i>card number</i> and <i>total cards</i>. When an order is made out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
as many copies are made as there are shops or departments through
which the work must pass. The number of the copies of the order
is entered under the heading <i>total cards</i>&mdash;that is, if the work is to
pass through four shops, the figure 4 is entered in the space provided
for total cards. The copies are numbered in the order in which the
work will be done&mdash;that is, the order for the shop that does the first
work is given No. 1, the second shop No. 2, etc.</p>

<p>There are two special advantages in having the shop orders
numbered. Each foreman knows, when he receives his order, how
many operations are ahead of his own and how many follow, and
can lay out his work accordingly. It does not always follow, however,
that because one foreman receives order No. 3, two other
operations must be completed before his own can be started.
Each shop order may call for the manufacture of a different part,
to be sent to the assembly shop, but if one of these parts is in stock,
no order is issued. The foreman receiving order No. 2, when his
number naturally would be 3, knows that one of the parts is in stock
and that his operation must be hurried accordingly.</p>

<p>The employes in the cost department find the numbering system
invaluable, for it enables them to tell how many operations there
are on a job; also operations which have been completed. This
information is of considerable assistance in tracing orders through
the shop.</p>

<p>The shop order shown in Fig. 43 answers the same purpose
as the form shown in Fig. 42. Instead of the system of numbering
the order copies, the plan of inserting the names of all shops is
followed. Following the name of each shop is the name of the
operation to be performed. This also enables the shop foreman
to so lay out his work that the order can be handled promptly when
it reaches his shop.</p>

<p><b>25. Work Orders.</b> The work order is the written instruction
of the foreman to the workman to do certain work. As a rule, this
order is made on the production time card, as shown in preceding
pages. Sometimes, however, it is unnecessary to give more explicit
directions than can be written on a small card, which makes it advisable
to issue a special order.</p>

<p>In certain classes of work, also, it is advisable to use one work
order for a job which is to pass through the hands of several men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Such a work order is shown in Fig. 44. This order shows the numbers
of the men and machines to which the work is to go. Another
class of work for which special orders should be issued is outside
repair work&mdash;as plumbing, steam fitting, electrical repairs, etc.</p>

<p><b>26. Standing Orders.</b> Manufacturing is fast developing into a
system of producing standard parts to be assembled into complete
machines and appliances. Every part that goes into a machine is
made from a standard pattern and is interchangeable with the same
part in every other machine of the same style made in the same shop.
It is no longer necessary to design each machine, and each part required
to fill an order&mdash;the parts are manufactured in large quantities
and carried in stock till needed. An order from a customer may
require the manufacture of one special part, the balance consisting
of parts to be assembled.</p>

<p>The manufacture of parts as standard units is not an accounting
problem, but the accounting department and the manufacturing
departments must coöperate in maintaining proper records of
the manufacture of those parts. The manufacture of one lot of
standard units involves the same operations whenever the same unit
is made. Adopting this principle to accounting, it is advisable to
establish standards in respect to orders. Whenever the same standard
part is needed, the order should be for the same quantity; this,
of course, after a standard quantity has been established. When
units and quantities have been standardized, order numbers should
be made standard&mdash;whenever the same work is to be done the <i>same
order number</i> should be used. If this plan is followed, orders are
soon recognized by number&mdash;and the order number informs the
foreman as to the work required.</p>

<p>Series of order numbers should be assigned for different classes
of work. Numbers 1 to 100 might represent regular plant maintenance
and repair orders; numbers 101 to 200, plant construction
and special repair orders; numbers 201 to 400, the manufacture of
special tools; numbers 401 to 1000, the manufacture of parts; numbers
1001 to 1500, assembling or production orders for complete machines.
Shop orders can be distinguished by a second series of numbers starting
at, say 5000.</p>

<p>Illustrating the above, the superintendent of a typewriter factory
might receive order number 1007, meaning that he is to assemble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
1000 No. 7 typewriters. His assembling order to the foreman would
bear the same number. After the parts have been drawn from the
parts storeroom, it may be found that the stock of certain parts is
running low. Production orders are issued for parts, No. 417 being
the number for frames for No. 7 machine. The shop orders may
bear the numbers 5060-<i>a</i>, 5060-<i>b</i>, and 5060-<i>c</i>, <i>a</i> being the order for
the foundry, <i>b</i>, the order for the machine shop, and <i>c</i>, the order for
the finishing department.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 45. Manufacturing Order Register, Showing Location of Work in the Shop</p>
</div></div>

<p>As to expense orders and construction orders, it is very necessary
that the work to be charged against each order number be
clearly specified. When the expenditure involved exceeds a certain
amount, or where the work is of a special nature, a special order
should be required. Explicit instructions for charging all expense
items should be given to each foreman, preferably in printed form&mdash;or
in typewritten form when the number of foremen is small. Many
concerns issue printed instruction books containing the order numbers
and specifications, with any rules that may be in force governing
the conduct of employes, for general distribution among employes.</p>

<h3 class="p2">RECORDS OF MANUFACTURING ORDERS</h3>

<p><b>27.</b> An essential record in any system of cost or factory accounting,
is a record of manufacturing orders. A system of records shouldbe maintained, which will show the exact number and nature of the
orders issued to the shop or factory, and from which it will be possible
to locate every order&mdash;to determine in what stage each order is, and
to estimate closely the date of completion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-137.jpg" width="400" height="671"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 46. Front and Reverse of Card Showing Total Production and Progress of Orders.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Such records are equal in importance to records of material,
both raw and partly finished, in store at all times. Without them,
it is impossible to obtain authentic information about work in process.
Orders are certain to be side-tracked, and it is extremely difficult
to estimate, with any degree of accuracy, delivery dates for either
new or old orders.</p>

<p>The records should be so complete that it will be literally possible
to run the business from the office&mdash;without calling foremen
from the shops, who must return and investigate the condition of
an order before an intelligent answer can be given. The manager
who can conduct his business from the office is following modern
ideas; he is far-seeing&mdash;not lucky&mdash;for this condition is the result
of carefully made plans to insure records that will show him exactly
what he wants to know.</p>

<p>Along the line of running the business from the office, Mr.
F. E. Webner, in an article in the <i>Engineering Magazine</i>, cites an
apt illustration. Two very large corporations with a common line
of product were concerned. Each of these in turn was asked verbally
by an executive officer of a concern which is a large user of the product,
as to what delivery could be made on a stated quantity of goods.
One concern used the long-distance telephone to a number of its
plants; the other concern consulted records within its office and was
able to give a decisive reply within half an hour, and to know just
which of its works was best able to turn out the goods. The first
concern had a number of superintendents on edge looking up data
and could not give a positive answer short of two days.</p>

<p>As in every other department of a business, the expense of maintaining
an adequate system of order records in the manufacturing
departments is infinitesimal, when compared with the results obtained.
A single contract lost for the lack of needed information may mean
the loss of a valuable customer, the profit on whose business would
pay the cost of an adequate system many times over.</p>

<p><b>28. Manufacturing Order Register.</b> The form of the manufacturing
order register necessarily depends on the nature of the
business, the product, and the number of operations or departments
through which an order must pass. It need not be complicated&mdash;simple
forms always are to be preferred&mdash;the main thing is that all
orders be so recorded as to be readily located.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>A simple and convenient form for a register of manufacturing
orders is shown in Fig. 45. This should be in loose leaf, a sheet
being used for each style or size of machine, part or piece manufactured.
If, for instance, a typewriter is made in five styles, five
sheets would be used&mdash;one for each style. Separate sheets would
also be used for each part&mdash;as many sheets for each as there are sizes.</p>

<p>The sheets should be indexed under the names of the parts and
those in each division arranged in the order of sizes. Supposing
type bars to be made in ten sizes&mdash;numbers 191 to 200&mdash;the sheets
would be filed in the order of these numbers. Should the industry
be one in which orders are issued to assemble parts into complete
machines, the sheets on which assembling orders are recorded
should be filed with a separate index, but may be kept in the same
binder. It is also advisable to use sheets of a different color for
these orders.</p>

<p>The heading of this form, Fig. 45, shows the name of the part,
the machine on which it is used, the drawing number, pattern number,
and style or part number. Orders to manufacture are entered in
the columns at the left of the body of the form, giving the date, order
number, quantity ordered, and total ordered to date&mdash;that is, if 500
parts are ordered on the 10th and 300 on the 25th, the sum of the
two, 800, would be entered in the total column. Following the
order record columns are columns for the departments, the form illustrated
being designed for a furniture business. Under the heading
for each department, a daily record is made of the quantity received,
quantity delivered to the next department or to stock, and balance in
the department, the latter being in an uncompleted state. This
form can be adapted to almost any class of manufacture by a proper
arrangement of departmental columns.</p>

<p>In most all industries, it is practical to keep a continuous record
of all manufacturing orders; sometimes it is best to keep a record for
each order. A form of this class, designed for the use of a machine
shop, is shown in Fig. 46. This form shows the progress of a single
order through all of the departments. A card is used in this case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
both sides being required to accommodate the number of operations,
and they are indexed by order numbers.</p>

<p><b>29. Tracing the Order.</b> The system of tracing orders through
the shop or factory is very important and should be as nearly automatic
in operation as possible. There may be many orders which
need not necessarily be traced, but a system that will automatically
keep the office informed on the progress of <i>all</i> orders, will pay for
itself in the time saved in tracing a single order without proper
records. To attempt to find the exact condition of work in progress
without a tracing and recording system, is not alone expensive, but
unsatisfactory in results; the degree of accuracy is measured by the
ability of foreman to make accurate estimates. Practically, foremen
should be best able to estimate the time required to complete a job,
but their estimates will be found to vary greatly on similar jobs;
time standards are more accurately determined by a comparison of
the records of past performances.</p>

<p>When practical&mdash;and it has been found practical in many industries&mdash;a
transfer office should be maintained in the works. This
office should be in charge of a transfer clerk, who will record all
transfers of work in progress from one department to another. Theoretically,
all work should pass the transfer office. In the manufacture
of small parts, this can be done without loss of time, provided
the transfer office is centrally located. When heavy work is
the rule, it is not practical to carry out this plan in detail, but such
transfers should be conducted under the supervision of the transfer
clerk.</p>

<p>The transfer clerk should maintain records of orders in progress,
which will be duplicates of the office records, reporting all transfers
to the office on the form shown in Fig. 47. This is a simple report
form, giving order numbers, part numbers, quantities, and names of
the departments between which transfers are made.</p>

<p>When no transfer clerk is employed, it is necessary to obtain
reports, in the same form, from the different foremen. This report
should provide for an acknowledgment of the receipt of work, as
well as a record of deliveries. The form shown in Fig. 48 gives a
double check, since the quantities received must agree with the
report of deliveries from the department from which the work was
received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>From these reports, the order records are made in the office.
In addition to their value in maintaining a record of orders, the
tracers and reports are used to advantage in compiling an inventory
of work in progress.</p>

<h3 class="p2">EXPENSE DISTRIBUTION</h3>

<p><b>1.</b> In order to obtain a thorough understanding of a subject,
and to gain a clear insight into the various questions involved, so
that one may understand not only its underlying principle, but also
its operation in detail, it is quite essential to know first, <i>why</i> a thing
is done, and second, <i>how</i> to do it. While a general knowledge of a
subject is always desirable, and to be commended, it is often found
insufficient when put to the test. Special subjects require special
consideration and study, especially when the how-to-do-it is involved.</p>

<p>On the subject under consideration this is particularly true,
for it seems to be a common confession among those handling factory
accounts, that while they know in a general way how their expense
accounts should be treated, they seem to be in a maze when
it comes to actually doing it. The "knowing how" is the best asset
of a good accountant; and in these days when the subject of costs is
of vital interest to the manufacturer, the up-to-date accountant has
the opportunity to show his value. To make the necessary repairs
to a touring car broken down on the country road may take but one
dollar's worth of the repairer's actual time, but the "knowing how"
may be worth ten dollars to him when rendering his bill, and usually is.</p>

<p>While it is realized that there are differences of opinion among
accountants on some of the questions considered in the presentation
of this subject, it is the intent of this article to present what is generally
conceded by our leading accounting authorities as the best
practice in a well-organized, up-to-date, industrial plant, and to so
present the subject to the prospective student that he may fully
understand and master the "why" and the "how" of this important
question in factory accounting.</p>

<p>That the subject may be carefully considered in all its various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
phases, it will for convenience be developed under the following
general divisions in the order in which they are naturally suggested:</p>

<p class="pbqn p1">(1) Basis of Expense Distribution.<br />
(2) Methods of Expense Distribution.<br />
(3) Percentage Method Exemplified.</p>

<h3 class="p2">BASIS OF EXPENSE DISTRIBUTION</h3>

<p><b>2. True Cost&mdash;What Is It?</b> Without trespassing on the general
subject of cost accounts, it is quite essential to clearly establish
at the very outset what constitutes <i>true cost</i>. It would be difficult
to conceive of a manufacturer to-day who would simply take the
value of wages paid and material used for a cost price, and to this
amount add the usual percentage of profit he desires to make on his
output, and sell at that price. It would be folly to attempt business
on any such basis. No business can be conducted without expense,
and yet, in the case just cited, the manufacturer has simply ignored
it. Suppose the expense of conducting his business exceeds the percentage
he added for profit, what then? He soon finds he has made
a serious error in figuring his cost, and the item omitted is the cause
of his business losses. His selling price was based on less than the
true cost of his product and it is noted he has made no provision, in
making up his cost price, for covering the expense of operating his
factory, his offices, and general expense, including insurance and
taxes. It is apparent then that this matter of <i>expense</i> has a very
important bearing on the cost, in fact is a part of it, and must be
carefully considered in making up the cost records. The factor of
expense is frequently found to be greater than the direct labor cost
itself, and a successful manufacturer must know how much expense
his costs should absorb and how to figure it. The sales from his
product must more than pay for the direct cost to manufacture and
all the expenses of his factory besides, and if his sales are not sufficient
to pay for both there is no profit. This expense, then, is an indirect
charge to the cost of production, and must be included in it before
the selling price can be established. Many a manufacturer has been
ruined by not properly handling his manufacturing expense, and the
necessity for its careful consideration cannot be emphasized too
strongly.</p>

<p>Mr. Clinton E. Woods, one of our leading authorities in factory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
organization and accounting, very clearly states that expense and
"overhead" charges must be absorbed into the cost of production
as much as labor and material, by which operation expense is really
converted into an asset.</p>

<p>True cost includes first, <i>direct labor</i>; second, <i>material</i>; and
third, <i>expense</i>. The last item will admit of further subdivision and
originates from two different sources: First, the expense of operating
the work-shop or factory itself; and second, the general expense of
offices and administration.</p>

<p>The cost of production, therefore, resolves itself into the following
elements:</p>

<table id="t03" summary="t03">

</table>


<p><b>3. Selling Expense.</b> <i>Selling expense</i>, oftentimes spoken of as
<i>commercial expense</i>, has no bearing on cost price. The correctness
of this position is easily shown. Two manufacturers, competitors
in the same line of production, both operating up-to-date plants with
the finest equipment, may produce at the same cost. The expense
necessary to market the product from one factory may be so excessive
as to cause one concern to lose business to their competitors who
can sell their output at less expense, while the actual cost to manufacture
may be identical in both shops. Again, while one manufacturer,
who can produce at a low cost but carries a heavy selling expense,
may conduct his business at a loss, his next door rival in trade
may not be able to manufacture as economically but can sell his
product with less expense, and thereby carry on a profitable business.
In the two instances cited, the key to the losses of one manufacturer
and to the profits of the other is in the expense of selling,
and not in the cost of production.</p>

<p>In a large plant with an elaborate, well-organized, and expensive
sales division, where the dividing line between the commercial and
production expense is clear cut, these two expense accounts should
be kept entirely separate; the commercial being charged off to <i>Loss</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and <i>Gain</i> direct, while the latter only should be merged into manufacturing
cost.</p>

<p>In a small plant, where the selling division is conducted through
the general office at an expense so small as not to affect the cost of
administration over what would be necessary for manufacturing
purposes only, or where there is difficulty in separating the selling
from the manufacturing expense, the two are often combined as general
expense and pro-rated as one account into production costs.</p>

<p>Theoretically, selling expense is not a charge to production, but
the dividing line between this view and the practical one in most cases
is a very fine one, and in the interest of simplification instead of elaboration,
the commercial will be treated in this presentation of the subject
as a part of the general expense, and will be considered in detail later.</p>

<p><b>4. Expense Based on Cost Price or Selling Price.</b> Having
shown that expense is of necessity an item which must enter into true
cost, the question at once arises as to what it is related. Is the
amount of expense to be borne by any article of production based on
its cost or its selling price? While it is noted that some accountants
claim the latter should be the basis for calculation, the consensus of
opinion seems decidedly in favor of the cost price as the correct one,
and there seems to be good argument for the stand thus taken:</p>

<p>(a) Inasmuch as the selling price cannot be established until
the cost price has been ascertained, which is to include the expense,
it is apparent that the expense must be calculated from data
already in hand; either the direct labor or material cost. The selling
price is established after, and contingent on, the cost price, not the
reverse.</p>

<p>(b) Again, the selling price may vary according to the demands
of trade; different prices to different classes of customers, as
well as the wholesale and retail prices for the same article. In
either case, the cost price is the same and is not influenced one way or
the other by the selling price. The selling price may fluctuate while
the cost price remains positive and stationary.</p>

<p>(c) While the selling price is theoretically based on cost, it
is often fixed by the trade, or regulated to meet competition regardless
of cost, and the expense accounts are found to continue about
the same each month whether the selling price is high or low.</p>

<p>(d) In times of depression, or when business is slack, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
common practice to "mark down" the selling price and increase the
amount of sales at a smaller percentage of profit.</p>

<p>(e) It is difficult to see wherein there would be any difference
in the expense of manufacturing an article which sells at $110.00 over
what it would be were the price but $100.00, yet there would be if
the selling price were used as a basis.</p>

<p>Other reasons will suggest themselves, but these just referred
to are quite sufficient to show that the selling price is too erratic and
that expense will be found more reliable when figured at cost price,
which method has, therefore, been adopted as the best practice.</p>

<p><b>5. Expense Based on Cost of Labor or Material.</b> Having
decided that expense should be reduced in some manner from the
direct cost price rather than the selling price, it is remembered that
we still have two items of cost to choose from: The labor cost and
that of the material. There are those who maintain that the material
cost is the correct starting point for calculations, but there are few
manufacturers, if any, who do this.</p>

<p>An attempt has been made to use the combined total of labor
cost and material, but this method is hardly worthy of serious consideration.
The best practice points almost without argument to
the labor cost as the true basis of expense; this is not only the logical
conclusion but common sense:</p>

<p>(a) It is easy to see that the elements which go to make up the
expense of operating a factory&mdash;foremen, sub-foremen, supervision,
shop clerks, toolkeepers and grinders, helpers, the up-keep of tools
and machines, lighting, etc.&mdash;are all closely related and largely dependent
upon the number of men employed. Reduce the number
employed and it will be seen at once that some of the above mentioned
items of expense can be cut; less supervision is required and
the wear and tear on tools and machinery is also reduced. It is
difficult to see wherein any difference in cost of the material used
would of itself cause any increase or decrease in the factory expense
or even be influenced by it. It is quite contingent on the labor.</p>

<p>(b) That the cost of the material is not a reliable basis for
calculating expense can be quite satisfactorily demonstrated. If
the cost of an article is, say, labor $25.00, material $50.00, with expense
to be figured at 50% on material, or $25.00, it is seen at once
that the manufacturing cost would be:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<table id="t04" summary="t04">

 <tr>
  <td>Labor</td>
  <td class="tdr">$25.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Material</td>
  <td class="tdr">50.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Expense</td>
  <td class="tdr">25.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdr">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Cost</td>
  <td class="tdr">$100.00</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p>Suppose this article were duplicated under the same identical
conditions and cost, using only this time material that cost $60.00.
It is a fair proposition that the total cost would be but $10.00 more
than in the first instance, or $110.00. But if the percentage is added
on the material as before, it is found that the expense this time is
$30.00, which would make the cost appear thus:</p>

<table id="t05" summary="t05">

 <tr>
  <td>Labor</td>
  <td class="tdr">$25.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Material</td>
  <td class="tdr">60.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Expense</td>
  <td class="tdr">30.00</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdr">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Cost</td>
  <td class="tdr">$115.00</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p>It is now noted that the cost figures $15.00 more than in the
first instance, while we are quite ready to admit it should be but
$10.00, the only difference being in the cost of the material.</p>

<p><b>6. Conclusions.</b> Having established the fact that the expense
is a legitimate charge to the cost of production, we are now quite
safe in laying down for our foundation the proposition that expense
is contingent on, and should be figured from, the direct labor value of
the cost price.</p>

<h3 class="p2">METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION</h3>

<p><b>7.</b> Time is continually bringing improvements; old methods
once thought practical and satisfactory are replaced by more efficient
ones to meet the exacting conditions of to-day. Examine a <i>Practical
Bookkeeping-Manufacturer's Edition</i> of thirty or forty years ago
and you will probably find nothing on this subject of <i>expense distribution</i>,
while to-day it is one of the most important and most discussed
of any in factory accounting in general, and cost accounting
in particular. Since that time different methods of handling expense
have been devised, some with more or less merit. It will be the
intent of this section to consider at some length three of the most
frequently used of these methods, endeavoring to find one which will,
in the most equitable manner, distribute into production the operating
expense of a factory with the least amount of detail and unnecessary
figuring on the part of the accountant; and at the same time prove
satisfactory from the manufacturer's standpoint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p><b>8. The Man-Hour Rate Method.</b> This method, once quite
popular, is now but little used, and it is doubtful if it can be found
in operation in many up-to-date plants at the present time. The
name of the method suggests its intent, which was to distribute
factory expense over the various production job orders according
to the amount of time spent by the workmen at an hourly rate. This
rate is easily calculated, and was established by dividing the total
expense for any period by the total number of hours spent on productive
work for the same period, reducing the rate of distribution to so
much per hour. If 100 hours of labor were spent on a productive
job, the cost of the wages paid the workman for this time was not
considered, the expense to be borne by the job being figured at the
hourly rate for the 100 hours. It will be seen that this is hardly an
equitable arrangement, and to rectify a serious defect in the method,
some adjustment must be made:</p>

<p>(a) The inability to fix a standard for the efficiency of the labor
lays the man-hour rate open to criticism. Could this be done, this
method would in many cases prove a very equitable way of distributing
expense. It will, however, be seen at once that as it is, a skilled
workman carries no more expense than an apprentice boy, and if
both work on a productive job a full week, the expense in either case
is the same regardless of the wages paid. This is hardly a fair proposition.
Either the apprentice's time must be accepted as standard
and the skilled workman considered twice as efficient in work-hours,
or <i>vice versâ</i>. To do this would lead to endless complications, yet
the quantity and quality of the output between these two classes of
labor should be considered and adjusted in some way so that the
injustice done the manufacturing cost may be corrected. But this
is not an easy matter to regulate, and means extra work on the part
of the cost clerks in recording the time spent on job work and adjusting
these inequalities in the labor.</p>

<p>(b) The man-hour rate requires that the hours worked be
carefully recorded and totaled, as well as the cost. Many concerns
with heavy pay-rolls to be apportioned over a large number of job
orders, ignore the footing of the long columns of hours and fractions,
and use only the totals of labor cost, which are of course necessary
for entry in the commercial books. It is obvious that in doing this
an immense amount of clerical labor is saved. The man-hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
method requires that both hours and labor cost should be recorded
and totaled&mdash;a double operation and duplication of work, which, unless
it can be simplified, should be avoided, as it means time and unnecessary
expense.</p>

<p><b>9. Machine-Hour Rate Method.</b> This machine-rate plan of
distributing expense was designed to meet the needs of a shop where
the product is largely the result of a machine or tool operation, rather
than the labor of the mechanic himself. It somewhat resembles
the man-hour plan in that the rate of distributing expense is reduced
to an hourly rate for the time the machine is working on the job
instead of the time of the operator. Each machine is intended to
have its own rate.</p>

<p>The method of arriving at the machine rate is easily understood,
and reduces itself to the item of depreciation on the original
cost price of the machine with its shafting, belting, tools, and installation
cost figured at, say, 5%, the power to operate machine at an
estimated cost per horse-power, ordinary repairs, divided by the
number of hours the machine is estimated to be in operation for the
same period; this will give the hourly rate of cost to operate. Some
mechanical engineers advocate including in the above cost, interest
on the investment at 6%, also insurance and taxes; and by others, the
value of the floor space occupied by the machine is also included;
but in all these latter points referred to, engineers greatly differ in
opinion, and it is generally decided by each manufacturer for himself
according to his own ideas.</p>

<p>On the question of the value of machine rates there is probably
more argument by mechanical engineers and accountants than on
any question in factory accounting; in fact, engineers themselves are
very far apart in their opinions and do not seem to agree among
themselves. Accountants generally are inclined to take a somewhat
different view of the situation from our mechanical friends. While
it is admitted there is good argument for both positions, it is to be
remembered that we are considering the question of machine rates as a
means of distributing the expense account, and it seems to be the prevailing
opinion among accountants that as such it is found wanting.
While, theoretically, it is undoubtedly the correct solution of the
problem, it is more often found in practice to be a case of a "distribution
that does not distribute," and for this reason is not used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
by the very class of factories and machine works for which it was
designed and intended to benefit.</p>

<p>Let us consider in detail a few of the objections that may be
raised to the machine-rate method:</p>

<p>(a) It will be noticed there are other expenses in the shop
than that of operating the machines and not covered at all by the
machine expense. Machine rates are absolutely worthless for bench
labor and the assembling room, for these two must also share in
carrying the shop burden. Not to do so would be manifestly unfair.
It is therefore necessary that a second distribution must be made
entirely different in its calculation, to handle this undistributed expense
not covered by the machine rates, which means two different
operations for the same shop.</p>

<p>This necessitates two different time records to be kept, one card
for each machine showing jobs worked on and hours idle, and another
time card for the workman. Is is easy to appreciate that this
double operation greatly increases the clerical work in the shop,
besides two sets of entries by the cost clerks, and more detail for all
concerned. If a method can be found which requires but one time
record to be kept, this double process can be done away with and the
duplication of work avoided.</p>

<p>(b) The principal factor in the calculation of the machine rate,
in fact, the real key to a successful calculation, is in establishing a
standard of work-hours for each machine. It is noted that the higher
the standard, the lower will be the rate, and the lower the hours operated,
the higher will be the rate; in other words, when the machine is
idle in excess of the standard, the rate changes. In some shops where
the output is a stable product, always in demand, and the machine in
continuous operation, a good estimate may be made, but in most
shops a machine is frequently idle on account of "no work" or "laid
up" for repairs the same as is its operator. The practice in most
shops is such that it is extremely difficult to estimate ahead what the
work-hours of a machine will be, and it resolves itself generally into
an intelligent guess with two estimators far apart in their estimates,
yet a satisfactory distribution requires a standard which will work
out in figures close to the actual facts.</p>

<p>Who can successfully estimate ahead for any time the activity
of each machine in a large factory? Our factory engineers are at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
wide variance on this point. One authority says "full time," 300
days a year, is the proper basis for calculation. It would seem as if
this were rather an unusual position to take; it apparently being his
belief that the time idle would be offset by the time the machine was
operated overtime, or else he expected the machinery once put in motion
to neither shut down, nor break down. Either appears to be rather
a dangerous assumption on which to base a careful calculation for
rate of distribution.</p>

<p>Another engineer says 80% of a full day will be found to be the
maximum, and further adds: "It will doubtless fall much below that
figure." One naturally asks "How much lower?" There is quite
a large field of figures to choose from between an 80% activity and a
dead standstill for the machine.</p>

<p>It is quite unnecessary to attempt to demonstrate at length that
the work-hour standard may be a very elastic figure, and it is often
found that after distribution has been made, the results are very unsatisfactory
and the machine rates used have proved "way off."</p>

<p>(c) Again, having settled on the work-hour standard, other
adjustments appear necessary to equitably handle the machine rate
question. For instance, two machines may be of the same book
valuation and in cost of operation practically alike, yet one may be
far more efficient than the other and possibly turn out two or three
times as much work. This condition is constantly found in different
shops, and whether or not the two machines should carry the same
rate, and, if not, how this inequality shall be adjusted, forms a very
interesting question for discussion.</p>

<p>(d) It is noted that the essentials in the calculation of machine
rates are all based on estimates which may or may not prove correct;
that positive book figures are lacking; and that the calculations are
made on assumptions. One of the best professional opinions noted
is that expressed by one of our leading accountants, who, commenting
on the question of machine rates, observes that "it begins with
estimating and is estimating all the way through." This appears
to be rather severe criticism, yet one has but to give the subject careful
consideration to note that it quite correctly sums up the situation
in a few words.</p>

<p>As previously stated, the machine-rate method is without doubt
theoretically correct, but, until the subject has been more thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
elucidated and worked out in all its details to fit shop conditions and
furnish a satisfactory means of distributing expense, it is doubtful
if it will be used to any great extent. This method certainly requires
an elaboration of system and detail, with questionable results, and
with many serious objections apparent; it seems pertinent, therefore,
to ask the question "Is it worth while; cannot something better be
devised?"</p>

<p><b>10. The Percent Method.</b> A third plan of distribution, commonly
referred to as the <i>percentage method</i>, differs from the two already
outlined, in which the time employed was the basis of operation, in
that the rate of distribution is a percentage on the direct labor cost of
the product, which is, of course, commensurate with the amount
of time expended. In the first division of our subject, it was shown
that expense figured on direct labor would prove the most reliable.</p>

<p>This method is based on the principle that the production of
each department of a plant should shoulder its own expense, and also
a share of the general expense. In other words, the cost of the output
from the <i>Blacksmith Department</i>, for instance, would be the total productive
labor of the department, plus the material used, plus the
operating expense of the department, plus its share of the general
expense of the whole plant. It is only necessary, then, to establish
the relation between the productive labor and the expense, and express
the same in a percentage. It is immaterial how many departments
or processes there may be in the factory; this relation should be found
in each case, based on its own productive labor and expense, each
department having its own percentage ascertained from its own actual
conditions; no estimating about it. The expense, then, is figured on
the labor cost. If, in the <i>Blacksmith Department</i> already referred to,
it is found that the expense at which the department is operated is
one-fourth of its total productive pay-roll for the same period, it is at
once apparent that if to the labor cost of every productive job, 25% is
added for shop expense, the total of these expense items added will
equal the total expense of the department. In other words, the shop
expense is split up and added to each job in proportion to the labor
expended on it.</p>

<p>The general expense is handled the same way. If the total
general expense is found to be one-third of the total productive
labor in the plant, it is likewise apparent that, if to the labor of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
productive job, 33⅓% is added to cover general expense, the sum total
of these percentage items added will equal the total general expense
of the plant.</p>

<p>Following, then, the formula outlined at the opening of our discussion
under the heading of <i>True Cost</i>, the cost of a job done in the
<i>Blacksmith Department</i>, on which the direct labor cost was $100.00,
would appear on our records as follows:</p>

<p>This is the <i>percentage method</i>. While it is quite natural in
anything of value and merit to look for its imperfections, this method
is criticised by some accountants who point to flaws in its logic and
method of computation; nevertheless, it stands to-day as the best
solution of the vexed question of expense distribution that has yet
been devised, for it not only has the approval of our best technical
authorities, but that of the practical accountant as well. It commends
itself to the intelligent judgment of the manufacturer, who is quick
to realize its superiority, and it can be recommended for many reasons:</p>

<p>(a) It is based on actual figures, easily extracted from the
regular books of account, and which are a true statement of fact;
no guess-work or estimating about it. There is no better way to
figure what is to be, than to use results of what can be conclusively
demonstrated already has been.</p>

<p>(b) It can be used in any manufacturing plant, or in all the departments
of the same plant, thereby insuring uniformity of method,
which is always desired. No argument is necessary to convince that
two methods in the same factory are undesirable when one can be
found that is satisfactory.</p>

<p>(c) It accomplishes its purpose&mdash;it distributes. If it is found
that factory conditions are changing, the percentages used may also
be changed so as to increase the amount of expense distributed, or
diminish it, as necessary.</p>

<p>(d) It requires less work for the cost accountant. The man-hour
plan requires the hours worked to be recorded and footed in
addition to the labor cost. The machine-rate plan requires not
only two different calculations, as already shown, but also necessitates
the adding of all the hours worked. The percentage plan requires
only the labor cost in money value, and renders the recording and
adding of long columns of hours entirely unnecessary, which, as can
readily be seen, is an immense saving of labor. In a large plant
with an elaborate system of job orders to be handled, the value of
the percentage method, in doing away with this double calculation,
will be appreciated immediately.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>(e) Figuring by percentages can be done rapidly, and in many
instances it is but a mental calculation and almost instantaneous.
Were hours recorded, the frequent use of fractions would render the
process of figuring expense less rapid.</p>

<p>(f) It is an equitable means of distribution, for it is based on
the direct labor cost, which is not only the most reliable element of
cost to use as a basis, but which is one of the principal factors by
which the amount of expense is influenced.</p>

<p>(g) It has the endorsement of our best factory accountants
and auditors, and it is noted that where "systems" are being installed
by factory organizers to-day, the percentage method is continually
being adopted as the most satisfactory, for it brings the best results
with the least machinery to operate.</p>

<h3 class="p2">PERCENTAGE METHOD EXEMPLIFIED</h3>

<p><b>11.</b> Before proceeding to show in detail the method to be pursued
in arriving at the various percentages to be used in distributing
expense by the <i>percentage method</i>, it may be well at the outset to
clearly understand what constitutes <i>productive labor</i> and <i>expense</i>, or
<i>non-productive labor</i>, for it is on the former that all calculations are
based.</p>

<p><b>12. Productive Labor.</b> The wages paid to the workmen for
labor spent on productive work which is offered by the manufacturer
for sale, and from which the business derives its regular revenue, is
properly classed as <i>productive labor</i>. In other words, the amount
of productive labor is commensurate with the productive output.</p>

<p>It is frequently asked whether labor spent on plant extensions
or new equipment, when made for one's own use, may be considered
productive labor and should carry its share of the expense in its distribution.
Most assuredly, yes. If this same work were performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to be sold again in trade it would be considered productive labor and
the expense would be added. The reverse is also true; if it were
purchased from another manufacturer he would treat it as productive
labor, and include expense in his cost and selling price, and the purchaser
would have to pay for it, and would carry same in his ledger,
in his plant or equipment accounts, and on his balance sheet as an
asset. The only difference, if any, is in making new equipment
himself, in which case it goes on his books at the cost price to him,
thereby saving the manufacturer's profit he would have to pay if he
purchased it. Is it, then, any less productive labor because a manufacturer
prefers to make his plant extensions or new machinery,
himself, instead of buying? It does not appear so; it certainly is
productive labor.</p>

<p><b>13. Non-Productive Labor.</b> All other labor, not distinctly
productive as just outlined, must be classed as non-productive.
This includes <i>clerks</i> and <i>offices</i>, <i>foremen</i>, <i>assistants</i>, <i>watchmen</i>, <i>repairs</i>
and <i>renewals</i>, <i>small tools</i>, etc., and all the many expense men
not working on product but necessary to keep the plant in repair and
operation. Non-productive labor is a question of keeping the factory
organization and management up to concert pitch, and is not
regulated by the quantity of production.</p>

<p>Inter-department work in a plant often raises an interesting
question. Shall labor expended by one department on repairs for
another department receive credit for same as productive labor?
The foreman of the department often claims that the repairs his men
are doing for another department are just as much production, so far
as he is concerned, as though his men were building a machine for
sale, and should shoulder part of his expense. In a certain sense, all
labor is productive, and from a selfish point of view, the foreman's
argument is a fair one. But from the broader view of the manufacturer,
all such inter-department repairs, or similar work, are a part
of the operating expense of the plant, and are necessary for the up-keep
of the equipment; they are not made for sale, as is a production
order, and must be carried as expense&mdash;non-productive labor.</p>

<p><b>14. Expense and Production Cost Ledgers.</b> Without digressing
from our general subject, it may not be out of place at this point
to call attention to a most convenient method of keeping cost records.
Inasmuch as the cost of production must absorb the expense costs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of manufacturing, it will be found advantageous to keep these two
classes of accounts in separate binders, putting all the non-productive
labor cost records in one binder, calling it <i>Expense Ledger No. 1</i>,
and all the productive labor in <i>Production Ledger No. 2</i>. When the
expense distribution is to be figured, it will be noted that all the entries
will be made in <i>Ledger No. 2</i>, while <i>Ledger No. 1</i> furnishes the
amount and details of expense to be distributed.</p>

<p><b>15. Period for Comparisons.</b> Having shown that our percentages
of distribution are based on the relationship of total expenses
to total of productive labor, the first step in our calculation is to draw
off from our ledgers a statement of each for the same period as a
basis for comparison.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-160.jpg" width="400" height="202"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 1. Private Ledger Labor Account</p>
</div></div>

<p>Inasmuch as there is generally found to be some item of extraordinary
expense that appears each month, comparisons made on
conditions shown by one month's operations are apt to be found
abnormal, while a comparison made on results of operations extending
over six months or more will give an average nearer the true condition
of the plant's activities than one made on results shown by
a shorter period.</p>

<p><b>16. Pay-Rolls Dissected.</b> For our first statement, let us examine
the pay-rolls and find out what portion may be classed as
non-productive labor and what as productive labor, both by departments
and in totals, our examination of same to cover a period of six
months as just suggested.</p>

<p>For the sake of illustration, let us take a plant with a weekly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
pay-roll of about $10,000. Ordinarily there will be four pay-rolls
each month, but in order to provide for thirteen rolls quarterly, it
will be necessary every third month to have the labor account cover
five weeks instead of four. Turning to our <i>Private Ledger</i>, we find
our <i>labor account</i> appears as shown in Fig. 1.</p>

<p>It is now seen at a glance that the total pay-roll for six months
is $266,155.00. It is now necessary to know the split-up of the above
figures into productive and non-productive labor by departments, and
this is easily obtained. By reverting to the pay-sheets, can be found
the total pay-rolls for each department during the above period, and
from <i>Ledger No. 1</i> can be found the portion of these same rolls that
were classed as non-productive labor, and the balance will be found
entered in <i>Production Ledger No. 2</i>, the sum total of which will in
each case balance with the totals in the <i>Private Ledger</i>. Every dollar
of labor is accounted for in either one or the other of the two cost
ledgers. Having done this, the labor statement resolves itself into
something like the following:</p>

<p>The above figures are all that are needed so far as the labor
end of the comparison is concerned. In fact, the non-productive
labor is not necessary and is shown here merely as a matter of interest,
as are also the proportionate percentages of each division to
the total pay-roll, for it will be remembered that the productive labor
is the figure used in all costs on which the expense is calculated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p><b>17. Departmental Expenses.</b> Against the amount of productive
labor for each department shown in the statement just made, place
the total expenses for the same departments. This is readily found by
again referring to the <i>Private Ledger</i>, where the amount of <i>Operating
Expense, Department E</i>, for the same months the pay-rolls were tabulated,
appears as in Fig. 2. The expenses of all the other departments
should be similarly treated.</p>

<p><b>18. General Expense.</b> The general expense of a plant, for the
sake of convenience as well as information, is kept usually in considerable
detail, different ledger accounts being opened to carry the
various subdivisions of expense. The use of a <i>General Expense
Account</i> in the ledger is not recommended, for its very name has
the earmarks of a general dumping ground for all miscellaneous
items, and is often found a convenient place to hide expense, trusting
it will there be lost sight of and thereby escape observation.</p>

<p>The combined total of these various expense accounts is the
total general expense, a part of which each productive job is to carry.
As they now appear in the ledger as separate accounts, <i>Executive</i>,
<i>Office</i>, <i>Store</i>, <i>Power</i>, <i>Yard</i>, <i>Taxes</i>, <i>Insurance</i>, <i>Printing</i> and <i>Stationery</i>,
<i>Telephone</i> and <i>Telegraph</i>, <i>Postage</i>, etc., it will be seen that each
account is in itself but a part of the amount to be distributed, and,
to better show this combined total, these individual accounts should
be closed out monthly and brought together in another account, called
<i>General Expense Distribution</i>. This is done by journal entry.</p>

<p>These accounts are now balanced out and combined in total in
the <i>Distribution Account</i>. The <i>Distribution Account</i> is now examined
to ascertain the total general expense for the same six months
previously used, and the <i>Private Ledger</i> shows it to be $67,840.00,
Fig. 3.</p>

<p><b>19. Power.</b> While the cost of operating the power-house is
unquestionably a legitimate charge to the operating expense of each
department according to quantity used, it is noted that, by the journal
entry just made, the cost of same is closed into <i>General Expense Distribution</i>.</p>

<p>In a plant operating a central power station with electrically
driven machinery, the power used in each shop can be metered and
accurately known, in which case, each shop can be charged with the
amount actually used. To do this requires considerable extra expense,
and although it is done in many works, most plants do not
consider the expense worth the results, and are inclined to treat all
power as general expense rather than departmental.</p>

<p>In a plant driven by shafting and belting, the power consumed
cannot be registered or recorded, and the power required only estimated
from tests made as often as desired. Although there may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
be a heavy draft on the power-house at certain times, when all the
machinery is in operation, there are frequently times when but few
machines are running and the power required is down, although
there is no way of recording it.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, extremely difficult to arrive at the actual power
used during a month, and for this reason most plants do not attempt
its calculation, and are quite ready to charge its cost off as a whole
to general expense. To departmentalize it, means extra expense

<p><b>20. Productive Labor and Expense Compared.</b> Having now
dissected the pay-rolls and drawn off the departmental and general

together to produce the final results. It will be remembered that
all that is necessary to know is the rate between the two, therefore

<p>The percentage columns shown give us what may be considered
a very close figure as to what are the actual factory conditions of
operating expense and productive labor, and the relationship of the
former to the latter. These results are all the more reliable because
they are based on actual figures taken from the books of the company,
thereby eliminating all estimating and the basing of important
calculations on guesses and assumptions, which later generally prove
to be far from the real facts in the case. The above results, gathered
from six months' operation of the plant, are a fair statement of what
the same expenses will be found to be in the long run, although if it
is desired to go into the matter still deeper, the same tabulation may
be made covering a year, with practically the same results.</p>

<p>What do the above figures show?</p>

<p>(a) That the total operating expenses of the plant are 59.1%
of its productive labor, of which amount, 32.6%, is necessary to
cover the general expenses, and 26.5%, the average for all shop
operations.</p>

<p>(b) That the expense of operating the different productive
departments vary according to conditions. That while <i>Department
E's</i> expense is found to be 21.8% of its productive labor, that for
<i>Department F</i> is found to be but 17.3%; each department having
its own rate based on its own actual figures.</p>

<p>(c) Since, as already shown, each department must shoulder
its own expense and its share of the general expense, it is seen from
results just shown that for every dollar spent on productive work in
<i>Department E</i>, 21.8 cents must be added to cover its own operating
expense, and 32.6 cents as its share of the general plant expense,
and that every dollar spent on production here cost $1.544. This
has been covered in detail under heading, <i>True Cost</i>.</p>

<p><b>21. How to Use Percentages.</b> Let us continue the use of the
same figures. It is apparent that, if to the cost of each productive
order worked on in <i>Department E</i> during the period of six months
just considered&mdash;all of which is shown in detail in <i>Production Ledger
No. 2</i>, the sum total of whose labor cost is $104,409.00&mdash;21.8% is
added, the amount thus added will be $22,731.00 (the actual figure is
a trifle more), which is just the amount of <i>Department E</i>'s expense
shown in the <i>Private Ledger</i> and found in detail in <i>Expense Ledger
No. 1</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, if to the cost of each productive order worked on by any
and all departments in the plant during this same period&mdash;the sum
total of whose labor cost is found to be $208,133.21 and which is
shown in detail by the individual cost sheets in <i>Production Ledger
No. 2</i>&mdash;32.6% is added, the amount thus added will be $67,840.00
(actual figure is a few dollars more), which is just the amount of total
expense shown by the <i>Distribution Account</i> in the <i>Private Ledger</i>.</p>

<p>It is now a simple proposition. Having found our average
ratio of expense to productive labor for each department, and also
for general expense covering a period of six months' operations, we
can begin to distribute the expenses of succeeding months on the
same basis with the same results.</p>

<p>In closing up the <i>Production Ledger</i> at the end of each month
preparatory to drawing off a monthly summary of all the totals
therein to obtain the total cost of production for the month for entry
through the journal into the <i>Private Ledger</i>, it is simply necessary
to enter on each cost-sheet, in columns provided for that particular
purpose, two items of expense, one for department expense and one
for general expense. In the case of <i>Department E</i>, just cited, the
expense for the department is to be calculated at 21.8%, and the
general expense item at 32.6%.</p>

<p><b>22. Even Percentages May Be Used.</b> In a large plant with an
elaborate system of manufacturing job orders worked on daily with
perhaps hundreds of cost-sheets on which an expense calculation
must be made, the use of percentages with three figures may require
more time in figuring than desirable, in which case an even percentage
may be used. Instead of 21.8 for <i>Department E</i> use 22, and for
general expense, instead of 32.6 use 33. This means that under
usual conditions, more expense would be added to production than
shown by the expense accounts, and the <i>Private Ledger</i> would show
whether there had been an over-distribution or an under-distribution
in each department's account after the distribution had been made.
Turning to <i>Private Ledger Account, Department E</i>, while it is shown
that, for January, the expense that should have been distributed, if
done exactly, would have been $3,697.33 (had the productive labor
for the same month been, say, $17,095.45), the amount added to production
by using 22% would have been $3,761.00, an over-distribution
of $63.67. To adjust this overdraft in figuring the next month,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
use 21%, the idea being to have the ledger accounts as nearly balanced
out as possible. Should the general expense rate prove more than
sufficient when 33% is used, reduce it or increase it to meet the fluctuations
of the expense, with the thought always in mind to keep all
balances as small as possible, and to make as nearly a perfect distribution
as figures will permit.</p>

<p>It is suggested that where these percentages come close to 16⅔,
20, 25, 33⅓, etc., that these figures may be used to advantage. By
so doing the expense calculations can be figured mentally and very
rapidly, and generally without interfering with a satisfactory distribution.
If, however, the overlap each month increases, these should
be modified to bring closer results.</p>

<p><b>23. Journal Entry for Distribution.</b> While it is not the intention
in the consideration of this subject of <i>Expense Distribution</i> to
depart therefrom into the general field of cost accounts and cost
records, it is assumed that on whatever form of cost-sheet used, provision
will be made for the proper recording of the three elements of
cost: labor, material, and expense, the latter in two items. Inasmuch
as only totals should be carried into the <i>Private Ledger</i>, it is only
necessary for drawing off the amounts on the individual sheets in
<i>Production Ledger No. 2</i> to provide summary sheets with sufficient
money columns to accommodate, among other credits, all items for
each department's expense and also for general expense. This,
when done and totaled, will give the total cost of production for the
month, made up of the following items:</p>

<p class="pbqr p1">(a) Labor&mdash;amount of which should check total of productive labor
shown by the dissection of the monthly pay-roll.</p>

<p class="pbqr">(b) Material&mdash;amount of which represents withdrawals from stores
during month.</p>

<p class="pbqr">(c) Departmental Expense&mdash;each separate, representing the amount of
expense actually distributed and thrown into production.</p>

<p class="pbqr">(d) General Expense&mdash;representing the total amount actually distributed
and absorbed by production.</p>

<p class="p1">This done, our journal entry will be:</p>

<p><b>24. Expense Ledger.</b> The totals from the <i>Expense Ledger</i>
should also be drawn off in a similar manner, and the same items will
appear as those shown in the <i>Production Ledger</i>, except that no expense
will be added, for it will be remembered that the entries in the
<i>Expense Ledger</i> constitute the very items which are transferred to
the <i>Production Ledger</i> through the percentage added.</p>

<p><b>25. Results of Distribution.</b> Having posted the journal, turn
again to the <i>Private Ledger</i> and note what has taken place. It is
found that the two items of labor posted have just balanced out
the <i>Labor Account</i>, and every dollar of pay-roll has been accounted
for somewhere, either into expense or into production. It it also
found that all the debits in the shop-expense accounts have originated
in <i>Expense Ledger No. 1</i>, and the credits have originated in the
<i>Production Ledger</i>. The various subdivisions of general expense
have been consolidated in one <i>Distribution Account</i>, which has also
been disposed of through the <i>Production Ledger</i>. What once appeared
as an expense cost has now been wiped out, absorbed by
production and converted into an asset, just as Mr. Clinton E.
Woods, previously quoted, states it should be. A glance at the trial
balance reveals scarcely a trace of expense, the small undistributed
balances only remaining.</p>

<p><b>26. Undistributed Balances.</b> Under any method of distributing
expense on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis, it is apparent there will be small balances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
left, representing either an over-distribution or an under-distribution,
as already explained. These may be treated in either one of
two ways. If the product manufactured has been practically completed
during the year, and but little carried over into the next year
to be finished, these balances can be charged off and become a part
of the <i>Loss and Gain</i> account for the year in which they were created,
and the new year begun with a "clean score."</p>

<p>If the product, however, consists of large contract work but
partially finished when the year closes, the work on same continuing
for some time into the new year, these balances may be also carried
over to be worked out in succeeding monthly distributions as the
work continues. When this latter method is chosen, of course it will
be necessary that these balances be taken into consideration when
preparing the <i>Balance Sheet</i>.</p>

<p><b>27. In Conclusion.</b> While it is realized that the <i>Percentage
Method</i> is not perfect in all its details, yet it is quite generally admitted
to be the best means that has yet been devised for distributing
expenses. A manufacturer using it may be assured that his costs
thus figured are correctly shown, from the fact that this method is
used and recommended by our highest technical authorities in accounting.
From the practical side, it appeals to the manufacturer who is
more interested in successful manufacturing than he is in the science
of accounts, by the simplicity of the method and economy with which
it is operated. The same amount of time spent in planning economies
and devising means for cheapening the cost of production that is
often spent in lengthy attempts at fine figuring, which, when
finished, prove unsatisfactory, will be productive of far better results.
Any method which eliminates the unnecessary and simplifies the
essentials cannot help but prove attractive both to the successful
manufacturer and the progressive accountant.</p>

<h3 class="p2">OPERATING EXPENSE STATEMENTS</h3>

<p><b>28.</b> To properly analyze detailed records, and to be able to
extract therefrom the essentials and eliminate all items of minor
importance, so that the exact situation and final conclusions can
be expressed briefly and in an attractive manner, is an art in itself.
A bookkeeper may be ever so well posted in up-to-date methods,
and his books may show great care, and be models in appearance, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
when it comes to preparing an intelligent statement of any feature
of the company's business, he may be sadly deficient. It does not
necessarily follow that because he can do the one thing well, he can
make a success of the other. Even as the pleasure naturally to be
derived from a carefully prepared dinner may be completely wrecked
by poor service, so can the intent of what would otherwise be an interesting
tabulation of statistics be made meaningless by the presentation
of a jumbled and carelessly arranged lot of figures.</p>

<p>It is as necessary to clearly show <i>on paper</i> the results of the factory
operations as it is that they should be correctly recorded on
the company's books. While the two operations are entirely distinct
and separate, they are closely allied, and every progressive accountant
should be interested in both.</p>

<p>The object of a statement is to convey to the reader certain
information in an intelligent manner; if it does not do this, it might
as well not have been written. This leads us at once to the question:
"What constitutes a good statement?"</p>

<p><b>29. Lengthy Statements Undesirable.</b> That we may have
"too much of a good thing," and that even those things worthwhile
may be overdone, is true in the matter of statements. The general
tendency seems to be to elaborate rather than simplify, and to
crowd into the tabulation a lot of figures representing details which
are almost always passed over without examination, or are even
hardly looked at. If the same amount of time is spent in studying
such a statement that is spent in its preparation, it would not be
altogether without value, but the fact remains that it seldom is thus
considered.</p>

<p>The size of a company's statement is oftentimes all out of proportion
to the size of the business; some of the smaller industries
present reports of their operations so voluminous in size as to
rival that of the United States Steel Corporation, or that prepared
by the actuary of one of the mammoth insurance companies.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that a busy manager is more interested
in economical management than in wholesale bookkeeping, and has
but little use for a formidable array of figures, except in so far as
they show general results. Such a statement, when presented to him,
is usually tossed aside to be examined later, while if it were condensed
and served up to him in a more attractive form, it would probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
be eagerly examined and studied with interest. A multitude of
figures is more apt to confuse than to enlighten the situation, is a
waste of an accountant's time, and, being a source of displeasure to
the employer, thereby defeats the very object for which it was made.</p>

<p>Detailed records should always be kept, and in such shape as
to be immediately available when called for, but it is hardly necessary
to incorporate them in a tabulation intended to show results.
It will be well, in submitting figures to the manager, to always bear in
mind an imaginary notice over his desk: "This is my busy day; be
brief." It is safe to say that a good statement should contain as few
figures as possible to intelligently show the desired result.</p>

<p><b>30. Tabulate the Essentials.</b> The data for a good statement
should be well chosen. A manufacturer wants results. He is in
business for profit making, and wants to know the true condition of
his shop operation and the expense, in a concise presentation of
facts, and has but little use for comparisons beyond those necessary
for showing him the result of his management. He is not often found
to be a philanthropist, eager to load down his expense account so
that his clerical assistants may use his time to pursue their studies
in the science of accounting. He wants to know what his costs of
production and the expense of operation are, and where they may be
cut, and it is as much to an accountant's interest to show him this
in a clear and self-explanatory statement as it is by an elaborate and
dazzling array of statistics to show his own ability in handling figures.</p>

<p>A manufacturer will doubtless obtain just as much solid comfort
and real pleasure in knowing that special tools recently made
have enabled him to clip a few cents off the cost of one of the units
of his product, and that economics in his shops have reduced his
operating expenses 2% or 3%, as to be furnished the startling information
that his <i>Printing and Stationery</i> account is .7148% of his <i>General
Expense</i>, his <i>Insurance</i>, 6.2714%, <i>Postage</i>, .5218%, <i>Telephone</i> and
<i>Telegraph</i>, .6538%, and so on down the list.</p>

<p>The illustration used is not an imaginary one either. Statements
are occasionally seen wherein all the individual items of expense
are thus figured and the percentages carried out four decimal
places. Of what conceivable use can such figures be? The only
imaginable excuse seems to be that the accountant hoped to lower
these percentages in the next period&mdash;possibly the third and fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
figures in the decimal&mdash;by bringing pressure to bear on the telephone
company and on the insurance underwriters sufficient to get the rates
reduced, and by telling the mail boy he must use less postage stamps.
Rather a peculiar method of cutting expenses, and it is quite safe to
say that the same effort applied in other directions would be productive
of far more satisfactory results. A good statement, then, should be
clear, concise, and complete.</p>

<p><b>31. What the Statement Should Show.</b> The two elements
in a factory, in which the management is directly interested, are
the <i>productive output</i> and the <i>operating expense</i>. The former
should be pushed to the utmost limit, while the latter should be
trimmed at every point possible; and it is readily seen that the point
of greatest efficiency is reached when the plant is producing at its
full capacity. A factory with a complete organization is operated
at a heavy expense when running at but 50% of its full capacity.
These two elements, output and operating expense, are so closely
related that a change in one immediately affects the other, and
the relationship between the two, which is expressed in a percentage,
is either raised or lowered according to the character of the
change.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">(a) If the operating expense remains stationary and the production
increases, or</p>

<p class="pbq">(b) If the operating expense is lowered and the production remains
unchanged, or</p>

<p class="pbq">(c) If the output increases at a greater rate than the expense increases,
or</p>

<p class="pbq">(d) If the output decreases at a lower rate than does the expense,
then the percentage which expresses the ratio of expense to production is
lowered, which means increased operating efficiency and a decrease in the
cost of production.</p>

<p class="p1">On the other hand:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">(a) If the operating expense remains stationary and the production
decreases, or</p>

<p class="pbq">(b) If the operating expenses are on the increase while the production
remains unchanged, or</p>

<p class="pbq">(c) If the operating expenses increase faster than the production
increases, or</p>

<p class="pbq">(d) If the operating expense decreases at a less rate than does the
productive output, then these tell-tale percentages automatically increase
also, which the manager is quick to note, and mean a falling-off in the economy
with which the plant is being operated, for increased expense means increased
cost of production.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">This means, then, in order to be in complete control of his plant,
a manager must have production costs and operating expense well
in hand, for these two factors are the keys to successful management.
It is up to the accountant to show the manager, in figures, the facts
as to the true conditions in the shops, and the statement presented
to him monthly must be sufficiently explicit to show him at short
notice what the expense of operating each department of his plant
has been, and what the items were that made it up.</p>

<p><b>32. Comparative Figures.</b> It is quite unnecessary to demonstrate
the value of comparative statements, for this is generally admitted
without argument. They portray at once whether what now
is, shows an improvement or a falling short over what has been;
in fact the degree of success or failure in any line is gauged by comparison
with results previously attained.</p>

<p>A statement showing operating conditions with those of a previous
period cannot help being interesting as well as instructive; in fact
it is from this source that a manager obtains the information which
enables him to size up the changing conditions in his plant, and in
case of loss in efficiency, shows him where the remedy should be
applied.</p>

<p>If a comparison or test is made between the operating expense
and productive output, covering a period of, say, six months or a year
for each department or process in the plant, as well as for the general
expense, the resulting percentages show what the factory conditions
will average in the long run. Any departure or deviation from this
average in any succeeding month, as shown by the operating statement,
serves to indicate to the manager what he may expect as the
results of the present period when actual figures are in hand and
actual results known. If a falling off in efficiency is noted, opportunity
is offered to make economies before it is too late, and for the balance
of the period to make a better showing. While it is true that an
extraordinary expense, such as a breakdown of machinery, may
cause an unfavorable showing for a particular month, it is quite
essential that this long run average should be closely followed, in order
to show that the previous efficiency has again been maintained, or
better still, improved upon.</p>

<p>A comparative statement shows at once any radical departure
from normal conditions and accepted standards, and is, in reality,
the manager's barometer of factory operating. The discovery
that his operating expenses are increasing without a corresponding
increase in the output, means that the storm signals are immediately
raised, and there are likely to be squalls ahead in the department
responsible for the increase, with an explanation in order
from its foreman. The operating statement, then, should show
up excessive operating expense, what it is, where it is, and what
caused it.</p>

<p><b>33. Source of Data Used.</b> Having now in mind what characteristics
should be embodied in the tabulation, proceed to gather
the necessary data for the statements.</p>

<p>Continue the original plan and make the <i>Operating Expense
Statement</i> consistent with the <i>Percentage Method</i>, and extract the
data for same from the cost records and books of account in a factory
where this method is used.</p>

<p><b>34. Expense Manufacturing Departments.</b> First prepare the
shop operating expense statement for the manufacturing departments.
If the cost records have been kept in two binders&mdash;one for
operating expense in <i>Expense Ledger No. 1</i>, and the other for production
in <i>Production Ledger No. 2</i>&mdash;the procedure is simple. The
<i>Private Ledger</i> account for each department shows the total expense
for each month posted in total, with all the details shown in <i>Expense
Ledger No. 1</i>, to which now refer.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as everything is charged to some job number, both
labor and material, it is simply a matter of drawing off the job totals,
which will check the department total expense as shown in the
<i>Private Ledger</i>. A convenient grouping of job numbers will be
found of great assistance; say</p>

<p class="pc"><i>Jobs 1-99.  Standing expense orders.</i><br />
<i>100-999.&nbsp; Special expense orders.</i></p>

<p>Generally, <i>Job 1</i> is used to cover miscellaneous expense costs
not covered by other job numbers, and includes <i>foremen</i>, <i>sub-foremen</i>,
<i>clerks</i>, <i>tool-room men</i>, <i>helpers</i>, <i>watchman</i>, <i>small repairs</i>, etc., both labor
and material. In the matter of repairs, it will be noted that such
charges originate from two different sources: those done by the department
for itself, and those done for the department by another department,
and frequently spoken of as <i>inter-department</i> work. By
providing two cost-sheets for labor items on <i>Job 1</i>, one for direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
labor charges, and the other for inter-department labor, the two
items may be easily kept separate.</p>

<p>The material on <i>Job 1</i> should also be kept in the same manner.
The reason for this is apparent, as it shows up at once how much a
foreman is charging to his department himself, and how much is
being charged to him by other foremen on inter-department work.</p>

<p><i>Jobs 2, 3, 4</i>, and so on down the list, can cover the various subdivisions
of shop expense, such as new small tools, repairs to tools,
repairs to machinery, and as many detailed items as may be considered
desirable. If expensive repairs are to be made to one of
the large machines, it is desirable to keep a separate cost of same by
assigning a special job number for the work, say <i>Job 100</i>, rather
than throw the cost into one of the standing orders, where it is lost.
In fact, a limit of cost should be placed on all new tool-costs, or repairs
chargeable to standing orders, so that these jobs may not be used as
a dumping ground for extensive repairs, which a foreman may be
inclined to conceal from the manager's notice, and for which a special
permit should be given by the manager, and job number assigned,
before such repairs are begun.</p>

<p>The productive labor of the department will be found in <i>Production
Ledger No. 2</i>, the total of which, if added to the total of the
non-productive labor found in <i>Expense Ledger No. 1</i>, will equal the
total department pay-roll.</p>

<p>The resulting percentage of expense to productive labor expresses
the ratio existing between the two, and is used as the basis for distributing
the same expense over the various items of production.
The question of distributing expense is only referred to here, having
been discussed at length elsewhere. Inasmuch as it will be seen that
this percentage will fluctuate somewhat each month, it will be well
to show on our statement, the same percentage for the previous month
for comparative purposes. The extent of the monthly fluctuation
is the key to the situation, for these percentages sum up in one figure
the actual results of shop management, toward the lowering of which
the best energies of the manager are always directed.</p>

<p>For the sake of illustration, take a plant with a weekly pay-roll
of about $10,000.00. Having drawn up a form in which the
features already discussed have been provided for, extract from the
<i>Expense Ledger</i> some imaginary figures. The expense accounts
of the different producing departments in the plant will appear as
shown in Fig. 4.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>After studying the same a moment, what will the manager of
the plant discover? Among other things he will see at once:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">(a) The total expense of operating each department in the works,
with the principal items which go to make it up.</p>

<p class="pbq">(b) That the total productive labor was 79.9% of the total monthly
pay-roll while the non-productive was 20.1%; that the former has been apportioned
over the various departments and every dollar of same accounted for.</p>

<p class="pbq">(c) The ratio of expense to productive labor for each department reduced
to a percentage, the average of which for all the productive departments
is 25.7%.</p>

<p class="pbq">(d) From the comparative figures, that the August percentage showed
an improvement in operating expenses in most of the productive departments
over those for July and that they are a trifle lower than the average for the
first six months of the year.</p>

<p class="pbq">(e) That the operating percentage for <i>Department F</i> has jumped up
4.7%, which means that something is wrong in that department, and must be
investigated.</p>

<p class="pbq">(f) That for every dollar spent for productive labor, he must add 56.8
cents to cover operating expenses, of which amount, 25.7 cents covers the
expense of operating the shops and 31.1 cents covers the general expense of
the plant.</p>

<p class="p1">The item of <i>General Expense</i> = 31.1% is not derived from any
figures that appear in this statement, but is taken from the tabulation
covering <i>General Operating Expense</i> presented later. It is
desirable to have this appear here, as well as the <i>Department</i> average
percentage, in order to show the total operating expense (56.8%) on
the labor, bringing total plant results on one sheet.</p>

<p><b>35. General Expense Statement.</b> This statement serves as the
companion sheet to the one just shown for <i>Departmental Expense</i>,
every operating expense appearing on either one of these two statements.
It is drawn off in just the same manner as the <i>Departmental</i>
statement, the total of the various expense accounts in the <i>Private
Ledger</i> and the details of the four expense departments shown in
<i>Expense Ledger No. 1</i> checking the total <i>General Expense Distribution</i>
account shown in the <i>Private Ledger</i>. It will be seen at once
that the <i>General Expenses</i> of the plant may be reduced to the following
general divisions:</p>


<p class="pnr05 p1">Special Ledger Accounts:</p>

<p class="pnr10">Executive, Insurance, Taxes, Depreciation, Freight, Express, Cartage,
Printing and Stationery, Telephone and Telegraph, Traveling,
Postage, Legal, etc.</p>

<table id="t12" summary="t12">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>General Expense Distribution</i> account referred to originates
by closing monthly all the various ledger accounts listed above into
one account. This brings all these scattered expense accounts together
in one total, necessary not only for the purpose of distribution,
but for convenience in ascertaining and handling general expense.
The details can be readily taken from the individual accounts before
thus closed, while <i>Departments A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, and <i>D</i> are carried in detail
in the <i>Expense Ledger</i>. The total <i>General Expense</i> shown then by
the statement will check the total shown by the <i>Distribution</i> account
in the <i>Private Ledger</i>.</p>

<p>The form Fig. 5, will be found a very convenient and satisfactory
exhibit. Detailed explanation is quite unnecessary; the
tabulation explains itself and needs no assistance. The general conclusion
arrived at is that the plant's general expense is found for the
month of August to be 31.1% of the productive labor; in other words
31.1 cents must be added to every dollar of productive labor to cover
its proportion of the general and administration expense of the plant.
The same figures are also shown for comparative purposes for the
previous month, and also for the first six months of the year; the manager
can see at once exactly how the plant is running.</p>

<p>The same summary figures are placed at the bottom of this
statement as were shown on the departmental statement, that each
may show the final results of the other.</p>

<p><b>36. Statements for Foremen.</b> It is often asked whether or not
it is a good plan to furnish the foremen of the various departments
any cost figures. In a good many shops, it is the rule to <i>tell them
nothing</i> and to keep them in entire ignorance of their expense costs,
the feeling being that in case of an unsatisfactory showing they will
be inclined to <i>doctor</i> their expense returns by diverting them into production
in order to make a more favorable showing.</p>

<p>While it is undoubtedly true that a foreman is frequently tempted
to resort to such measures&mdash;not a very far-sighted policy to be sure,
for it is bound to be shown up later&mdash;it would seem advisable to furnish
him a copy of his operating expenses not only for his information
but as an incentive to practice economies on his own initiative
without waiting for a <i>call</i> from the manager. Most foremen are
quick to see that it is for their own interests to do this and to make
the best possible showing for their department. It also creates a
good-natured rivalry among the various foremen, which tends towards
good results in which both foremen and management share.</p>

<p>The statement furnished the foreman is simply a copy of the
expense of his department as shown on the <i>Departmental Expense
Statement</i>, and may be made up substantially as shown on the form
herewith presented, Fig. 6.</p>

<p><b>37. Charts.</b> While the value of chart records is generally
admitted, there will probably be no one in the plant who will appreciate
this form of presenting figures more than the manager, who,
from his mechanical training, will at once grasp the situation as thus
presented. The general trend of operations for the whole period
is immediately revealed at a mere glance, without any systematic
study of the figures involved, and any unusual condition is detected
at once.</p>

<p>To show the possibilities of thus arranging comparative statements,
two charts, Figs. 7 and 8, are presented, on which are plotted
the same results appearing on the tabulated statements already
shown, or previously used for the purpose of illustration on Pages
31 and 34.</p>

<p>On one chart is shown the total pay-rolls with split-up of same
into productive and non-productive labor, with the percentage of
each on the total; the other shows the total expense, also subdivided
into shop and general expense, with the resulting percentages of
same on the productive labor as shown on the first chart.</p>

<p><b>38. In Conclusion.</b> While there is no end to the number of
statements that can be prepared and that can be elaborated almost
indefinitely, it is well to continually bear in mind that the statement
which best serves its purpose is the one which conveys the most information
in the fewest figures; is not overloaded with unnecessary
detail; whose tabulated data is well chosen, and whose make-up is
sufficiently attractive to cause it to be read and studied, and not thrown
into the waste basket.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">COST SUMMARIES</h2>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="p2"><b>39.</b> Any system of cost records is deficient that does not provide
for the tabulation of all items entering into the cost of individual
units or jobs, in such form as will permit of the computation of the
total of such costs for comparison with records of total manufacturing
expenditures. Three elements enter into the cost of the
finished product&mdash;<i>material</i>, <i>labor</i>, and <i>expense</i>.</p>

<p>Under the head of material is included the cost of materials of
all kinds of which the product is made.</p>

<p>Labor is of two classes, <i>direct</i> and <i>indirect</i>. Direct labor is
that which is applied directly to the manufacture of a given article;
indirect labor is that which, while necessary to the operation of a
shop or factory, is not applied to specific jobs or the production of
individual units. In a manufacturing industry operating a machine
shop, the labor of machine operators would be classed as <i>direct</i>,
while the labor of porters, oilers, and general workers employed in
the shop would be classed as <i>indirect</i>. The superintendent of the
plant, shop foreman, factory clerks, engineers, firemen, and general
workers also belong in the indirect classification. For accounting
purposes, indirect labor is divided into two classes&mdash;shop indirect
and general indirect. Shop foremen and general workers employed
exclusively in the operation of a single shop are properly classified
as <i>shop indirect</i>, and their wages are charged against the operation
of the shop. The superintendent, factory clerks, and general workers
necessary to the operation of the plant, whose time cannot be charged
against the operation of any one shop or department, are classified
as <i>general indirect</i>.</p>

<p>Expense includes all items entering into the cost of the product
or the operation of the plant, that are not included in the charge for
material and labor. Expense, like labor, is properly divided into
<i>shop expense</i> and <i>general expense</i>. General expense includes the cost
of all supplies and miscellaneous items of expense incurred in the
operation of the plant, which cannot be charged to individual shops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Such items as heat, light, building maintenance, taxes, insurance,
and depreciation belong in the classification of general expense.</p>

<p>Any classification of expense items that is not made with reference
to a specific plant, must be general; items that in one plant must
be classed as general expense, are applied in others as shop expense.
The item of power costs furnishes an example. In a plant equipped
according to modern engineering ideas, with electrical transmission
of power and each machine equipped with its own motor, an exact
distribution of power costs to individual shops is a simple problem.
The total cost of power for a month is divided among the several
shops in proportion to the amount used by each, as shown by meters.
Even the hourly cost of power for each machine can then be determined.
With a shaft-and belt-driven plant the problem of distributing
power costs is less simple. When power costs can be distributed
accurately to departments, however, it should be done; otherwise
such departments as the drafting room will be charged for power
when none is used.</p>

<h3 class="p2">COLLECTING COST DATA</h3>

<p><b>40.</b> For the purpose of making the necessary summaries, complete
details of all items of cost for each operation must be collected.
This data supplies the foundation for all tabulations of cost statistics.</p>

<p>The first step necessary to insure a record of the cost of manufacture
of a given article is the entering of a production order, followed
by the necessary shop orders, and the orders of the foremen to
the workers. The details of these orders are fully described in another
section.</p>

<p>When a foreman receives a shop order, his first duty is to ascertain
what material will be needed. He then orders this material
from the storeroom, using a requisition as described in the discussion
of systems for the stores department.</p>

<p>On receipt of the material the quantity is checked against the
foreman's copy of the requisition, which is then sent to the cost department.
In the storeroom, the necessary entries are made on the
stores records, after which the requisition is sent to the cost department.</p>

<p>When the foreman is ready to assign the work, he issues work
orders to his men. As explained in the discussion of labor records,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the usual form for work orders is a time-card. On completion of
each job, the men deposit the time-cards in the rack provided for that
purpose. These are later sent to the cost department.</p>

<p>In actual practice, it is usually best to have all requisitions and
time-cards collected once during each day by a messenger from the
cost department. Sometimes, the cards are also filled out in the cost
department and delivered to the foreman with his shop order, leaving
him to enter only the man's number. When this plan is followed,
the cost clerk must be familiar with all of the operations required,
and must keep the foreman supplied with work orders to keep the
shop employed for at least a day ahead.</p>

<p>The receipt of the requisitions and time-cards supplies the cost
department with the necessary data for material and direct labor
charges to individual jobs. Data for similar charges on account
of repairs is secured in the same way.</p>

<p>The character of the records compiled from this data determines
the real value of the entire system of cost accounting. If, as is so
often the case, the compiling extends no farther than a mere tabulation
of costs of individual jobs, it does not reach its full value as a
part of the accounting records. Like single-entry bookkeeping,
such records are no more than mere memoranda. The full value
is reached only when the records of the cost department are made a
part of the general accounting system of the business; where controlling
accounts absorb all individual items of cost.</p>

<p><b>41. Material Costs.</b> The compilation of material costs from
the requisitions should exhibit the total cost of all material used in
the plant and the total cost of material used on each job.</p>

<p>The records intended to exhibit the cost of <i>all</i> material issued to
the factory should be divided according to classes, following the
same classifications as used for material purchase accounts in the
general ledger. This is very important as the information secured
from such classifications is needed to form the connecting link between
the cost and general accounting systems.</p>

<p>The value of the accounting records is greatly enhanced if, in
the general ledger, a purchase account is kept for each class of material
and supplies. If but one kind of material is used, only one
material purchase account is needed, but in a furniture business,
for instance, separate accounts should be kept for purchases of lumber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and hardware; in a harness manufacturing business, accounts
should be kept for harness leather, patent leather, saddle leather,
and hardware. The proper classification for any special business
will readily suggest itself, but the material should be classified according
to its most natural divisions.</p>

<p>The stores records also should be divided according to the same
classifications, so that the records of material included in any one
purchase account can be checked, without reference to the records
of other classes. In the storeroom of a harness business, a card
or sheet would be used for the record of each item in the hardware
stock, while all of these individual records would be filed under the
general classification, <i>hardware</i>.</p>

<p>This method provides three records, each closely related to the
others. In the general ledger, there is a <i>hardware purchase</i> account;
in the storeroom, a detailed record of the hardware stock; in the
cost department, a record of all hardware issued to the factory. When
the cost department record is brought into the <i>hardware purchase</i>
account, by a credit through the journal, the balance of this account
should show the value of the hardware stock and should agree with
the records of the stores department.</p>

<p>The compilation of supplies costs should be made along similar
lines, and the same care should be used in the classifications. Fuel
purchases, for instance, should be kept in a separate account, while
general factory supplies&mdash;as oil, belting, waste, etc.&mdash;may be kept
in one account or subdivided, depending on the size and nature of
the business.</p>

<p><b>42. Material Cost Reports.</b> The material records of the cost
department relating to totals issued should be made in the form of
reports, as they will be required in the general accounting office.
These reports need not show order numbers, but should show whether
used on production, construction, or repair work. The supplies
record should show by what department the supplies are used.</p>

<p>Fig. 9 shows a form for a report of material costs. In the heading
is given the class of material, being the caption of the purchase
account in the general ledger, and the month for which the report is
made. The body of the report provides for a daily record of amounts
charged to production, repairs, and construction, with an extra
column for any special classification that may be needed at any time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>This form is in duplicate, the original being printed on light
weight paper to insure perfect carbon copies. A loose-leaf form is
most satisfactory because both copies, with carbon paper between,
can be kept in a binder and the entries made each day.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-190.jpg" width="400" height="341"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 9. Monthly Statement of Material Issued</p>
</div></div>

<p>Duplicate sheets are used for each material classification. Each
day, the amounts are extended on all requisitions. The requisitions
are then sorted according to material classifications, those applying
to production, repair, and construction orders being kept separate.
Those of each subdivision are footed, preferably on an adding machine,
and the total is then entered on the report.</p>

<p>For sorting requisitions, a box or rack, with compartments for
the divisions in each class, is most convenient. Such a rack is shown
in Fig. 10.</p>

<p>Reports of supplies issued to the factory are handled in the same
manner as materials. The form used for this purpose and shown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Fig. 11, is similar to the material report form, the only difference
being that amounts are distributed to the several departments.</p>

<p>At the end of each month, the report forms for material and supplies
are footed, the original is sent to the general accounting office,
and the duplicate is left in the binder in the cost department. When
the cost accounting is handled in the general accounting office, it
is not necessary to make these reports in duplicate; this is necessary
only when the offices are separated.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 10. Rack Used<br />for Sorting Requisitions</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>43. Labor Costs.</b> From the time-cards or work orders, labor
costs are compiled both for separate jobs and to show totals by departments
and for the entire plant.
The compilation showing totals
is made for the purpose of checking
the pay-roll&mdash;to prove that all
labor paid for has been charged
to factory operations in some
form.</p>

<p>The time-cards should first be
sorted according to departments,
then re-sorted to separate the
direct production, indirect production,
repair, and construction
labor of each department or shop.
The cards representing the different
classes should be footed on an
adding machine, and the department totals compared with the pay-roll
records. Daily comparisons should be the positive rule in order
that discrepancies may be adjusted while the matter is fresh. On
no account should the adjustment of discrepancies be omitted&mdash;labor
reports from the factory <i>must</i> agree with the pay-roll. Cards showing
the class of work done must be turned in for <i>every</i> man.</p>

<p>The tabulation of labor costs is really made for the purpose of
distribution; that labor charges may be distributed to the proper
accounts. The nature of the tabulation will, therefore, depend largely
on the class of business for which it is to be used. In some lines, costs
must be distributed by both departments and classes of labor; in
others, by classes of labor only; sometimes, by classes of product&mdash;though
this will usually be covered in the departmental distribution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>A form intended for the distribution of labor costs in a single
department is shown in Fig. 12. This form is in loose leaf and is
filed in a binder, the sheets being arranged in numerical or alphabetical
order representing the departments. If the cost and general accounting
departments are separated, this form should be in duplicate;
otherwise, one copy is sufficient.</p>

<p>In the body of the form, distribution columns are provided
for the different classes of labor&mdash;direct, indirect, repair, and
construction, with a column for any special classification that may be
needed.</p>

<p>After comparison with the pay-roll record, the total labor costs
are entered daily on this form. At the end of the month, the sheets
are footed and originals sent to the general accounting office.</p>

<p><b>44. Job Costs.</b> When they have served their purpose in compiling
total material and labor costs, the material requisitions and
time-cards are sorted by job numbers, direct and indirect, repair and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
construction cards being kept separate. Where operation costs
are desired, the time-cards for direct labor on each order or job number
are re-sorted by operation numbers. Totals of material costs
for each job, and totals of direct labor costs for each operation and
job are obtained, these amounts being the basis on which charges
to jobs for the day are made.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 12. Departmental Labor Distribution Sheet</p>
</div></div>

<p>The totals of each class, obtained from requisitions and time-cards,
must agree with the totals of corresponding classifications on
the monthly tabulation of material and labor costs, as in Figs. 9 and
12. Totals of material and direct labor for jobs and operations are
next entered on job or operation records, or both. As a rule, it is
best to arrange job records so that material and labor costs can
be entered daily, no matter how much time is required to finish the
job.</p>

<p>Fig. 13 shows a form designed for the assembling of material
and labor costs for a single shop or department. For the labor distribution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
as many columns as necessary are provided for the record
of costs by operations. In the material column, the kind of material
is entered and the amount extended. When the manufacture requires
operations in several shops, one of these forms is used for
each shop on each production order&mdash;that is, a form for each separate
shop order. When the job is finished, the costs for all shops are
assembled on one form to obtain the total cost of the job.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p>The total material and direct labor costs are brought down on
this form, but indirect labor and shop expense are added as a percentage,
as has been described in the discussion of expense distribution.
General indirect labor and general expense is added to the
combined total of all shop costs. In this connection it may be well
to emphasize the importance of distributing every expense possible to
individual shops, leaving only those items that cannot be so distributed
to be added as general expense. For the ostensible purpose
of reducing labor, it is the practice of some accountants to throw all
expense items into one class, adding the whole as general expense.
This is not to be commended, as it results in an unequal distribution.
In one shop, the ratio of indirect labor, or of the cost of supplies, to
direct labor, may be much higher than in another; the expense for
oil, belt lace, waste, etc., is heavy in the machine shop&mdash;nothing in the
assembling shop. Adding all expense under one head, means that
the same per cent is added to direct labor costs in all shops to cover
these items; plainly, an unfair charge.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>A further reason for distributing expense to shops is, that costs
of separate operations are more accurately figured. To reach their
greatest value, cost records should reduce costs to the smallest possible
unit. Every detail should be shown, and these records should
be available for comparison.</p>

<p>Fig. 14 shows how the Boston ledger may be used for a continuous
cost record. The regular form is used, five lines being set aside for
each job. The first line is for the job number, following which, material,
direct labor, indirect labor, and expense are entered. Under
each date, the first column contains particulars of previous costs, the
second, the costs added for the day, and the third column contains the
totals to date. It is not necessary to use the column for previous
costs except the first day for which the page is used; daily costs can
be added to totals for the previous day.</p>

<p>Several jobs can be recorded on one page and the record can
continue until a job is finished. Additions can be made daily, weekly,
or even monthly. This form is used to excellent advantage for contracts
that cover a long period.</p>

<p>When a large number of small jobs are going through the factory
at all times, the labor of the cost department can be reduced and, as
a rule, satisfactory results secured, if tabulations of job costs are
made when the job is finished. This should not be allowed to interfere
with the daily tabulation of total costs, but when requisitions
and time-cards have been re-sorted by job numbers, they may be
filed by these numbers, in a job rack&mdash;new cards being added from
day to day until the job is finished. Tabulations can then be made
of material costs, showing the quantity and cost of each kind used,
and of the labor costs, showing costs by operations or by order numbers.</p>

<p>Each business requires its special form for job cost records. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
form must provide for the information of greatest importance to
the business in which it is used. The forms shown herein are submitted
as examples for their suggestive value.</p>

<p>Fig. 15 shows a form adapted to many lines. This form is
intended for a record of the cost of parts, but could be used for
assembled machine costs. Provision is made for detailed labor costs
by man, numbers, and kind of work. It will be noted that, after
obtaining the actual manufacturing cost&mdash;material, labor, and factory
burden&mdash;profits are added. In our opinion, profits have no
place in cost records. To establish a selling price, it is legitimate
to add a factory or manufacturing profit before adding a percentage
to cover sales expense and a selling profit, but the addition of these
percentages has no bearing on the actual manufacturing cost.</p>

<p>Fig. 16 is a representative form for a machine shop. All operations
and materials are listed by name, totals only being recorded.
Factory expense is added to the labor cost, while a percentage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
cover loss and waste is added to material costs. This form is subject
to the criticism that all expense is added as one item&mdash;no provision
is made for segregating the expense of each shop.</p>

<p>The form shown in Fig. 17 is adapted to a small shop, or for
repair jobs. This is the most simple form that could be devised;
columns are provided for all essential information, and all items are
to be written in.</p>

<p><b>45. Comparative Cost Records.</b> The chief value of cost
statistics lies in the opportunity offered for comparison. The fact
that the last lot of part No. 10 cost $1.17 each, does not, of itself,
indicate that the cost is either low or excessive; but if our records
show that two previous lots have cost $1.20 and $1.21 each, the comparison
reveals the fact that the cost is low.</p>

<p>Valuable as this comparison is, it would be still more valuable
if it showed <i>why</i> the cost is less. Suppose labor and material costs
are segregated. Comparison shows that the reduction of three cents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
is made up of one cent material and two cents labor. Now if the
quantity and cost of each kind of material used, and the time and
cost of each operation are segregated, an analysis will show the exact
operations on which the saving has been made. It will be found,
perhaps, that the cost of operation No. 10 was actually decreased
three cents, but that the cost of No. 16 increased one cent. Why
these variations? Was some unusually favorable condition responsible
for the saving on No. 10, or can the new cost be maintained?
Can the cost of No. 16 be brought back to the former figure?&mdash;these
are the questions to be answered by the production engineer.
The records of the accountant supply him with the means of comparison&mdash;point
out both saving and waste. Profiting by the information,
the engineer devises ways of approaching more closely to
maximum standards of efficiency.</p>

<p>Comparative records should, therefore, provide for a comparison
of every item entering into manufacturing cost. Comparisons
should be based on standard units; if two jobs are to be compared,
they must be identical or the comparison is of no particular value.
The modern method of manufacturing standard parts makes comparison
of practical value. Savings and wastes are more readily
located in the manufacture of parts, than in building a complete
machine.</p>

<p>To provide for an analysis of material costs, the form shown in
Fig. 19 is used. This is similar to the form shown in Fig. 18, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
difference being that it shows detailed costs of each separate kind of

<p>Fig. 20 is a card form used for a monthly comparison of costs of
standing orders or expense orders, with labor and material costs
separated. The form provides for a comparison of monthly costs
covering a period of four years&mdash;a very valuable record. As
an illustration of the manner of using this form, it will be supposed
that machine shop repairs are made on order No. 460. Both
material and labor are included in the cost of repairs. One of
these cards would be used for this order and, at the end of each
month, the totals of material and labor used on machine-shop
repairs would be entered. The total would be extended in the
third column.</p>

<h3 class="p2">CONTINUOUS PROCESS FACTORIES</h3>

<p><b>46.</b> A distinct class of manufacture, which involves certain
special problems in cost accounting, is the business in which the
process is continuous. For convenience, we refer to such factories as
<i>continuous process factories</i>. Any factory in which a definite quantity
of raw material is converted into a finished product, the quantity of
the product not being definitely determined in advance, is classed
as a continuous process factory. Examples are flour mills, sugar
and salt refineries, nail mills, button and pin factories, and yarn mills.</p>

<p>The problem in factories of this class is to find the total cost of
production and the total number of units of production; the former
divided by the latter will give the cost per unit.</p>

<p>The cost of production includes the cost of material, labor, and
expense. It is necessary, therefore, to keep an accurate record of
material and supplies issued to the factory, just as is done in factories
manufacturing goods on special orders. Labor costs should
be recorded by departments, and the distribution of expense should
be by departments, as far as possible. Forms similar to those shown
in the preceding pages can be used.</p>

<p><b>47. By-Products.</b> A special problem found in certain industries
is to provide for an accounting of salvage, which is either sold
in its natural state or manufactured into other products&mdash;known as
<i>by-products</i>. For example, the operation of the cutting room of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
harness factory is a continuous process&mdash;sides of leather are cut to
produce the largest possible quantity of stock that can be used in the
manufacture of harness. The pieces produced vary in size, and it
is necessary to figure the cost of cut stock by weight. After this
stock has been produced, there remains a certain quantity of scrap
leather. This scrap leather is not worth what it originally cost in
the sides of leather, but has a certain market value. It should,
therefore, be weighed and the value credited against the gross charge
for leather to the cutting room.</p>

<p>Now, some manufacturers, instead of selling this scrap as it comes
from the cutting tables, convert the best of it into such by-products
as heels and washers, selling the residue as scrap. Here is an added
manufacturing process&mdash;a new department, operated because the
price obtained for the by-product makes it profitable. The natural
thing to do is to keep accurate cost records for this department,
charging the material at scrap prices and take credit for the profits.
But some accountants contend that the value of the by-product&mdash;less
cost of production&mdash;should be credited against the material
charge to the principal product. Provided the volume and value
of the by-product is small, there is no serious objection to this plan,
but it is not a safe rule to follow.</p>

<p>In some industries, the value of the by-products is greater than
that of the so-called principal product. The large soap factories
make glycerine and other by-products of greater value than the soap
products. So profitable is this branch of the business that the scrap
or residue from the manufacture of soap, is bought from smaller
factories, to be used in the manufacture of these by-products. The
by-products from the manufacture of gas produces a revenue, in
the case of a large gas company, more than sufficient to pay the entire
cost of operating the plant. Under these conditions, it is readily
seen that the manufacture and sale of by-products should be treated
as a distinct branch of the business; otherwise it might easily be shown
that the principal product is without cost.</p>

<h3 class="p2">PRODUCTION RECORDS</h3>

<p><b>48.</b> Methods of recording the cost of material and labor used,
and of tabulating these costs for individual jobs, have been discussed
in the preceding pages. To complete the cost department records,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
there should be a record of total production&mdash;a record showing the
cost of all finished jobs. This information has an important bearing
on the general accounting system.</p>

<p>The form of the report of production will naturally vary in
different lines of business, though the information needed follows
the same lines in all cases. The essential feature is an exact record
covering every article manufactured in the factory; and every order
for parts must be considered as an order for finished product.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-205.jpg" width="400" height="342"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 21. Monthly Recapitulation of Job Costs</p>
</div></div>

<p>Sometimes daily reports of finished orders will be required by
the main office, especially when the factory is located at a distance.
As a rule, however, a report covering a period of a week or a month
will serve the purpose.</p>

<p>A form that is adapted for most industries, and for daily, weekly,
or monthly reports, is shown in Fig. 21. In the heading of this
form, provision is made for the name of the department. When it is
desired to keep separate records of two or more classes of goods made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
in the same factory, it is necessary to make a report of each class.
The class is usually indicated by the name of the department; when
it is not, the name of the class should be substituted. The body of
the form records the date started, order number, date finished,
quantity, and cost in detail.</p>

<p>The making of this report requires very little additional labor in
the cost department. Each day, when costs are tabulated on the
finished job cost cards, the details are entered on the report, each
job being placed in its proper class. At the end of the week or
month, the total column is footed and the report is sent to the general
accounting office. If the office and factory are widely separated,
the report should be made in duplicate, and a copy retained in the
cost department.</p>

<h3 class="p2">CONTROLLING ACCOUNTS</h3>

<p><b>49.</b> Certain controlling accounts are required in the general
ledger to complete the connection between the cost and general
accounting system&mdash;to bind the two together. These controlling
accounts, which absorb all of the elements of cost from month to
month, furnish the means of proving the accuracy of cost figures;
they change the cost system from single entry to double entry.</p>

<p>Two controlling accounts are necessary&mdash;<i>Manufacturing</i> and
<i>Expense Distribution</i>. The former finally absorbs the latter and is,
therefore, the principal controlling account.</p>

<p>One manufacturing account may represent the entire product of
the plant, or there may be several accounts representing different
classes of goods, or departments of the business. In machinery
manufacture, the foundry is frequently treated as a separate business;
in the manufacture of knit underwear, the yarn and knitting
mills are operated as separate plants; in a harness factory, separate
accounts are kept of the manufacture of harness, collars, and saddles.
Each of these divisions, whether departments or kinds of goods, calls
for a manufacturing account.</p>

<p>Expense distribution is subdivided in every business having
more than one department or shop. The subdivisions of this
account are <i>General Expense Distribution</i> and <i>Shop Expense Distribution</i>,
an account with the latter being kept for each
shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>The sources of charges to manufacturing accounts are reports of
material issued to the factory on production orders, Fig. 9, reports
of direct and indirect labor employed on production, Fig. 12,
and the expense distribution accounts. Credits to manufacturing
accounts are derived from reports of finished jobs, as in Fig. 21.</p>

<p>The sources of charges to expense distribution accounts are:
reports of material issued to the factory to be used for repairs,
Fig. 9, reports of supplies issued, Fig. 11, reports of labor employed
on repair jobs, Fig. 12, and the different accounts covering
expense items that must be apportioned. A credit to expense distribution
account, with a corresponding charge to manufacturing
account, closes this account monthly.</p>

<p><b>50. Controlling Account Entries.</b> The accuracy of the entries
to controlling accounts in the general books is of the utmost importance.
Upon them depends the proof of accuracy of the cost figures
of the cost department on individual jobs.</p>

<p>Material and labor costs are accurately determined. The value
of material drawn for all purposes, as shown by the report in Fig. 9,
is credited to material purchase accounts, and these accounts are
checked against the storeroom records. Reports of supplies drawn
are handled in the same manner. The labor report, Fig. 12,
covers all labor charges and must agree with the pay-roll for the
period covered.</p>

<p>In the distribution of expense, however, there are many opportunities
for error. While the total expense to be charged against
the factory for a given period is accurately determined, the amount
is not known until the end of the period. This is represented by the
amounts charged to the different expense distribution accounts. In
the meantime, to determine the cost of individual jobs, it is necessary
to apportion expense on a percentage basis, as explained in the discussion
of that subject. Since that ratio for the current period is
unknown, it is necessary to assume that the actual ratio for the preceding
period still is correct; therefore, that ratio is used in figuring
the cost of all jobs. It is only when the expense distribution for the
current period is made on the general books and the true ratio determined,
that discrepancies, if any, are discovered. Unless the distribution
is accurate, the resulting ratio will be incorrect.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-208.jpg" width="400" height="253"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">GENERAL OFFICES OF THE PLATT IRON WORKS, DAYTON, OHIO</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Formerly, it was the custom to base the expense ratio on the
actual figure for the preceding year, which meant that changes in
expense ratio were not taken into account for an entire year. As a
result, the total manufacturing cost shown by the books at the end
of the year, did not agree with the costs as figured in the cost department;
it was usually much higher.</p>

<p>By operating the controlling accounts, making accurate distributions
of expense, the period can be limited to one month. Discrepancies
are then quickly discovered and the necessary adjustment
made in the expense ratio used. If it is found, at the end of the
month that the true ratio of expense is higher or lower than for the
preceding month, the percentage to be used for the next month is
raised or lowered accordingly. With a careful distribution of the
expense items each month, the variations in the ratio should be very
slight.</p>

<p>The objection is sometimes made that a monthly distribution of
expense is inequitable&mdash;that certain expenses may be abnormally
high in some months and below the average in others. But with
proper controlling accounts, this objection ceases to be serious.
Certain expenses are paid in one month that should be distributed
over an entire year&mdash;as taxes, insurance, and repairs. The amounts
charged to the expense distribution accounts each month, are only
the amounts that should be apportioned to that month. Taking
taxes as an example, one-twelfth of the entire amount should be
charged each month.</p>

<p>As an example of adjusting entries for controlling accounts,
journal pages are illustrated, in Fig. 21, containing entries made at
the end of the month&mdash;with explanations. It will be noted that the
last entry is a charge to <i>manufactured goods</i> account, and a credit
to <i>manufacturing</i> account of the total cost of finished goods, as shown
in the report, Fig. 20.</p>

<p>This account, <i>manufactured goods</i>, occupies the same position
as a purchase account. It represents the cost of finished goods to the
commercial division of the business. To this cost must be added an
amount sufficient to cover selling expense and provide a profit, as is
done when goods are purchased for resale. Selling expense should
not be included in the cost department's figures; nothing should be
added to the actual cost of manufacture, unless it is desired to add
a small amount to provide a factory profit.</p>

<p><i>Manufacturing</i> account has been charged for the cost of manufacture&mdash;material,
labor, and expense&mdash;and credited with the cost
of finished goods. This does not close the account, however, because
all jobs started have not been finished, as there still is work in
process. The <i>balance</i> of the manufacturing account, then, represents
the cost of this work and should agree with an actual inventory of
work in process.</p>

<p>No attempt has been made to describe a cost system for a particular
business&mdash;principles only have been considered in this discussion.
Proper application of these principles, however, will result
in a practical system for any manufacturing business. The exact
manner of applying these principles&mdash;the detail&mdash;depends on the
nature of the business; the results desired are the same in all lines.
Physical conditions, nature of the product, the policy of the management,
the manner in which the business is conducted&mdash;all of these
factors must be studied and given due consideration in outlining the
system. Then the most simple system that will produce results is
best, but in the effort to make the system simple, <i>necessary</i> details
should not be overlooked. It must be remembered that in a comparison
of details of cost, increases are more quickly located than if
the comparison refers to finished work.</p>

<h3 class="p2">MANUFACTURING</h3>

<p><b>Manufacturing Conditions and Developments.</b> Millions of
dollars are annually spent in building new factories. Other millions
are spent in equipping them with the best machinery that trained and
experienced men have been able to devise. Still more millions of
money are annually paid to the officials who manage and the employees
who man these enormous manufacturing plants.</p>

<p>Why? Why could not these expert employees labor in their own
homes or their individual shops, and produce the manufactured goods
without all these enormous expenses? What are the necessities which
impel men to spend these vast sums of money in erecting, equipping,
and operating these immense plants?</p>

<p>Casually considering the question, the <i>factory</i> or <i>manufacturing
plant</i> does not seem to be a real necessity. A large force of
employees working under a single management does not seem to be
the most economical method of producing the desired goods. Certainly
every man is free to choose his own particular line of work;
and there are many persons who, seeing a large force of employees
giving their entire life work to the enrichment of successful manufacturers,
while the employees themselves work long hours at hard
and laborious tasks and fare so poorly that they are seldom enabled
to save any considerable portion of their wages, not infrequently ending
an industrious life in poverty and want, are led to believe that the
factory is not a necessity or even a benefit to mankind, but rather a
means for reducing the individual worker to a condition of grinding
servitude, voluntary perhaps, but often the result of dire necessity.</p>

<p>These people, considering all the hardships in the life of factory
employees, are likely to hold and often to express the opinion that the
highest welfare of the human race really demands a return to the
simpler life of early days, when a much larger proportion of the people
lived upon farms, producing their own provisions, raising the flax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and the wool wherewith they clothed themselves, quite independently
of the wealthy classes, whether bankers, capitalists, or manufacturers,
the factory as we know it to-day having hardly begun its marvelous
era of existence.</p>

<p>Let us consider for a moment how all this has come about. In
the earlier years of the independence of this country, the chief dependence
was upon the results of agricultural work. In due time the
development of the resources of the country has placed manufacturers
at the front, so that in very recent years the value of manufactured
products has become nearly double that of agricultural.</p>

<p>These results, like many others of a less notable character, commenced
from very small beginnings; and it has been by inborn mechanical
ability, remarkable ingenuity, patient development, and
tireless energy, that mechanical undertakings have been developed
from meager initial facilities, until, in the vast manufacturing enterprises
of the present day, the American mechanic in nearly all lines
leads the world in originality and practical achievement.</p>

<p><b>Early New England Mechanics.</b> When the early settlers of New
England labored under the restrictive and harassing laws of the
Mother Country, and under their administration were goaded and
exasperated beyond endurance in many ways, not the least of which
was that of being obliged to purchase many manufactured articles
from England at extortionate prices&mdash;or, if purchased from other
countries, still paying taxes to England for the privilege&mdash;they rebelled.
Determining to buy no more foreign goods, they set out, at
first in most clumsy and primitive fashion, to make for themselves
such articles as were really necessaries, and, in noble self-denial, to
live without those which they could not make for themselves. They
doubtless little realized, however, that they were thereby laying the
foundations of the greatest manufacturing country in the world. By
the principles thus inaugurated, they instituted the first industrial
<i>boycott</i> in the history of the country&mdash;the one that has had more important
and far-reaching influences than anything of the kind before
or since.</p>

<p><b>Industrial Freedom.</b> While the departure of the Pilgrims for this
country, and the making of their homes on the "stern and rock-bound
coast" of New England, were for the purpose of seeking religious
freedom, it is also true that freedom soon meant very much more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
this to them; and with a larger conception of their opportunities and
possibilities, some of which were in reality forced upon them by adverse
circumstances, there came to them the inspiration of <i>industrial</i> as well
as <i>religious freedom</i>. The world has seen and has given them due
credit for the determined and heroic manner in which they went
about their self-appointed task; and they have amply demonstrated to
posterity their appreciation of and grasp upon the possibilities and
conditions, and the breadth and nobility of character which they
exhibited in working out the many perplexing problems that confronted
them.</p>

<p><b>Development of American Industrial Enterprises.</b> American
manufacturing came into being with these small beginnings and crude
efforts to fashion those common objects of household necessity and
daily use, which, although crude and clumsy, yet answered the purpose
until supplanted later by those of more improved form and
workmanship. These primitive successes led to greater endeavors,
and developed into still broader usefulness, when the time came that
necessities had been provided for and luxuries were now demanded
by the higher plane of living to which the people had in due time
advanced.</p>

<p>Thus the crude beginnings and rude surroundings among which
the early American mechanic performed his work, were in his own
house. Soon he outgrew these primitive facilities, and built small
shops, frequently in the garden or back yard of his home. These
gradually enlarged. The development of the business demanded
increased facilities, and buildings were erected quite independent of
the home surroundings, and two or more men were associated as
manufacturers. These plants developed and enlarged, and in due
course of time became the machine shops and the factories, which
have since multiplied many hundreds of times, not only in number
and in value, but in influence and importance, until to-day our country
stands the foremost manufacturing nation of the world. This is
true, not only as to the volume and value of her manufactured productions,
but also as to their great range and diversity of kind and usefulness.
One by one the American mechanic has taken up the various
classes of work formerly monopolized by this country or that, failing
perhaps at first, but always progressing and developing, until, by native
ingenuity and unflagging energy, all obstacles have been overcome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
all difficulties put aside, new industries have come into being, and
other "victories" of peace "no less than those of war" have been
added to the laurels of the American mechanic and of his ever-ready
and ever-confident partner, the American manufacturer and capitalist.
It is to this combination, each confident of and faithful to the abilities
and honor of the other, and each acting his part in his own sphere of
usefulness, that the immense success of American manufacturing is
due.</p>

<p>The factories of to-day are the logical results of a natural growth
and development of the various branches of business for which they
were originally built and organized. As the buildings increased in
numbers and dimensions, the methods of construction, the equipment,
and the systems by which they were managed, developed methods of
greater economy and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Tools of the Early Mechanic.</b> The early mechanic had few tools
and appliances wherewith to perform his work; and these were crude
and primitive, consisting principally of a limited number of hand-tools
brought from the Old Country, and occasionally a hand-lathe of
modern dimensions and operated by foot-power. But with their few
tools and meager facilities, and animated by the condition that
"necessity is the mother of invention," these old-time mechanics proceeded
with practical common sense and ingenuity to design and construct
better tools and machines&mdash;which have continually developed,
until we have the splendid array of manufacturing machinery seen on
every hand to-day. As machinery developed, larger and larger
amounts of money had to be expended; and the banker had to be
called upon to provide it. Thus the capitalist became the partner
of the manufacturer, the one furnishing the mechanical ability and
inventive genius for the actual designing and building of machinery
and manufactured goods, while the other contributed the money to
carry on the work, and the business ability necessary to market the
product.</p>

<p><b>Relations of Capital and Labor.</b> In brief, this is the condition
to-day. But, says the carping critic, "there are often hundreds of
struggling and hard-working employees where there is one rich
manufacturer." This may be partly true, although it is a fact beyond
dispute that the American mechanic is the best paid workman in the
world. It is true that there are hundreds of workmen to one capitalist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Why? The Creator has so ordained that there shall be many of
moderate ability, and but few possessing the unusual ability and
talent to lead them. So it has ever been since the days of Moses, and
so it probably will ever continue to be. Doestick's regiment composed
entirely of colonels was a manifest absurdity, and so intended
as an illustration of a well-known and natural condition that should
be realized by every reasonable and thoughtful man who considers
these questions.</p>

<p>Considering carefully the great scheme of manufacturing, and
the immense industrial problem of supplying the wants of the people
of this great country and providing for the vast volume of trade that
goes abroad, by the modern manufacturing plants equipped with all
that is latest and best in machinery for every conceivable purpose, it
should not be forgotten that, as the very basis and foundation of the
whole, stands the modern <i>machine tool</i>, and that it is principally to
the great and important development of this that we owe primarily
our industrial growth and prosperity as a manufacturing nation.
To the machine tool may easily be traced the gradual but continued
upward tendency of the mechanic and his methods, from the hard
physical toil and small pay of the early days, to the immeasurably
lighter exertion and increased compensation made possible by the
highly developed condition of the automatic machines of the present
day. It has been an oft-repeated victory of "mind over matter,"
wherein <i>brains</i> have won where <i>hands</i> made but little advance; <i>ideas</i>
have developed wonderful mechanisms that have revolutionized the
earlier methods of manufacturing and raised the standard of mechanical
excellence beyond what was thought possible years ago, and at the
same time reduced the cost to a fraction of its former amount.</p>

<p>Here, again, the capitalist furnished the means whereby the
practical realization of the ingenious designs of the mechanic's fertile
brain became possible, and the successful combination of capital and
labor brought success to both.</p>

<p><b>Combinations of Capital.</b> But here comes our critical labor
agitator again with the comment: "It is all very well to talk about
the amicable relations of capital and labor, and how each ought to help
the other, but how about the great combinations of capital that we
ordinarily call "trusts"? To give a correct and intelligent, as well
as a fair and truthful answer to this question, we must know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
<i>conditions</i> under which the combination is formed, the <i>plan</i> upon
which it is organized, and the <i>object</i> of its formation. As these are
not given, we must assume the conditions of some well-known combination.
Let it be the United States Steel Corporation. One of
the foremost men in this combination has defined his position on the
subject, and in so doing has outlined the policy of the corporation,
by saying:</p>


<p class="pbq p1">"Any combination of capital which operates, <i>first</i>, to prevent competition;
<i>second</i>, to increase the price of the product; and <i>third</i>, to reduce
the wages of the workmen, is working under a trio of wrong principles that
sooner or later will bring about disaster."</p>

<p class="p1">Let us see how the actual operation of this combination of capital
really works out in practice.</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><i>First</i>&mdash;The Steel Corporation has never sought to prevent competition.
Steel mills, large and small, have operated when, where, and how they pleased,
with no interference from the Steel Corporation.</p>

<p class="pbq"><i>Second</i>&mdash;The price of steel has not been increased; on the contrary,
it has been greatly reduced under its management. Thirty years ago a very
indifferent quality of machine steel cost from 8 to 12 cents per pound. To-day
ordinary machine steel of a much better quality than that mentioned above
can be had for 2 cents a pound or less.</p>

<p class="pbq"><i>Third</i>&mdash;The wages of workmen have not only not been reduced, but
have actually been doubled since the labor troubles in the steel mills known
as the "Homestead Strike" (1892). The Steel Corporation has gone much
further than to double the wages of the steel workers. They have made it
possible for the workmen to become partners in the great work of the corporation,
by obligating themselves to sell to their workmen a certain amount
each year of stock in the corporation, so that the men who labor in the mills
may also become part owners and participate in the dividends resulting from
their work on exactly the same percentage as the capitalist himself does.</p>

<p class="pbq">Our critic comes back to the charge by saying that "the Steel Corporation
has bought up many steel plants in various parts of the country, and added
them to its already enormous properties." Quite true. And for what purpose?
Let us see what they do with these plants. How do they manage
this part of the business? What is their plan of working? The conditions
were these: Before the advent of the United States Steel Corporation, there
were many isolated steel manufacturing plants, each being equipped for the
making of a number of kinds of steel products&mdash;for instance, steel railroad
rails, structural steel, merchant bar steel, steel boiler-plates, steel tank-plates,
and so on. The equipment necessary for producing these different forms of
steel was very expensive; and inasmuch as a considerable portion of this
equipment for some particular kind of product would necessarily be idle on
account of the fluctuations of trade, the expense burden was abnormally high
on account of this idle equipment. How has this condition been handled by
the Steel Corporation? This has been the plan: Suppose they have purchased
five plants, each making the five classes of product indicated above, and working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
under the disadvantages of a variety of products. These plants are examined,
and inventories made of their equipments. It is then decided which mill is
best adapted for making each one of the five classes of products. Then there
is a redistribution of the equipment of the plants, placing in the plant selected
for it all that in the several plants is adapted to a certain product; removing
all the machinery from this plant that is not adapted to the particular product
to be turned out, to be distributed among the other plants according to the
particular class of products for which each one is designed. Thus each plant is
equipped to turn out the single class of product which is most appropriate for
it, by drawing upon the other plants for such machinery as they have which
may supplement its own in this line.</p>

<p class="pbq">By this plan, each plant makes but one class of product. Having the
best machinery from all the plants for this purpose, and concentrating its
energies on a single class, it is enabled not only to turn out a better product,
but to turn it out much more economically than before. As the workmen
become more expert on their single line of product, they work more efficiently
and consequently earn higher wages. All these conditions, producing an
economical output, enable the manufacturers to reduce the selling price.</p>

<p class="pbq">The conditions of economy brought about in the management of the
manufacturing operations and in marketing the product, are very marked
when a large number of plants operate under one general head. Again, with
the immense amount of capital at the disposal of such a corporation, it is
enabled to secure the services of the best experts, and the most valuable processes
in existence.</p>

<p class="pbq">There are many other advantages, not only to the corporation and its
employees, but to the users of its products, and so to the general public, when
a combination of capital is <i>honestly made and honestly administered</i>.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Betterment of Industrial Conditions.</b> What has been said of the
Steel Corporation as to favoring of employees, has been duplicated
in various ways by different manufacturers all over the country.
Factory sites have been beautified by landscape gardening, and trees
and shrubbery have made the surroundings of working men and
women pleasant and attractive. Land has been purchased, and
workingmen's homes built and rented to them at fair rates. Factory
dining rooms are provided; reading rooms, libraries, gymnasiums,
clubs, and social organizations are inaugurated; emergency hospitals
or "first aid" rooms are arranged, with all or nearly all these services
free except that provided in dining rooms, which is furnished at
actual cost. More recently, a firm in Connecticut announces that
it will furnish free medical attendance to all its employees and their
families.</p>

<p>Schools have been established for apprentices, wherein they
receive such technical instruction as may be necessary to their success
in the trade they are learning&mdash;and this, not only without expense to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
themselves or to their parents, but they are paid by the hour for time
spent in their school work, the same as for their time in the shop.</p>

<p>To foster a practical interest in the work of the shops, many
concerns have what is called the <i>Suggestion System</i>, whereby the
employees may make written suggestions of any improvements which
they desire as to shop methods and routine, the design and construction
of the product, and many kindred subjects, the best suggestions
made each month receiving prizes.</p>

<p>All of these matters emphasize the fact that the mutual interests
of the capitalist who manufactures and sells, and of the employee by
the efforts of whose hand and brain the products are being turned out,
are each year being recognized and in a very large majority of cases
are being acted upon in good faith.</p>

<p><b>Methods of Modern Manufacturing.</b> In former times, machines
were built one at a time or in very small lots. Parts were made and
fitted to the particular machine to which they belonged; and while the
same general form and dimensions were practically maintained, there
was no attempt made to render the several parts so exact as to fit upon
any other machine than the one for which they were intended. Systems
of gauges had not been developed, and the planer was yet a
comparatively new tool; much work was still done by hand, the hammer,
the cold chisel, and the file being the chief reliance of a large
majority of machinists. This was the state of the machine shop and
its methods nearly up to the year 1800.</p>

<p><b>Interchangeable Manufacturing.</b> The use of milling cutters and
the commencement of practically interchangeable manufacturing,
came into machine shop practice at nearly the same time. It has
been said that "but for the milling machine, there would have been
no such thing as interchangeable manufacturing." It might be
said with quite as much truth, that if the system of interchangeable
manufacturing had not been conceived, there would have been little
need for the milling machine. Each, to a great extent, depended very
much upon the development of the other&mdash;and upon a third factor,
the conception and development of the method of handling
work (particularly small parts) in jigs and fixtures.</p>

<p>Milling cutters were made in America by one of the early machinists,
a Frenchman named Vaucanson, who died in 1782. A
sample of these had a hexagonal instead of a round hole, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
pitch of the teeth was very fine, so that the cutter resembled a saw
rather than those at present in use. It is said that a man by the name
of Bodmer, in Manchester, England, had made a milling machine
in 1824.</p>

<p>It is altogether probable that Eli Whitney, the inventor of the
cotton gin, had built and used milling machines previous to this date,
as the following item of mechanical history would seem to indicate.
In January, 1798, Eli Whitney received from the United States
Government an order to furnish ten thousand muskets, of which four
thousand were to be delivered in one year, and the balance in two
years. Mr. Whitney went at the undertaking in a very thorough
and systematic manner. He first developed a water power; then
erected suitable buildings; considered and developed ways and means
for a larger and better product than had previously been realized;
designed and built machinery to effect it; and trained workmen to a
degree of skill necessary to success in their new employment.</p>

<p>The difficulties which Mr. Whitney encountered and the obstacles
which he had to overcome, were so much greater than he
anticipated that it was really eight years instead of two before he
had succeeded in completing the government order for the ten thousand
muskets. However, the progress which he had made in this
new enterprise, and the character of the product which he turned
out and delivered, were so satisfactory to the government officials
that Congress treated him with the greatest courtesy and consideration.</p>

<p>His shops were situated in the city of New Haven, Conn., and
soon became the Mecca of government officials, manufacturers,
traveling notables, and foreigners, who had heard of this wonderful
American mechanic and came to see his work for themselves&mdash;to
find that the system, the machines, and the tools which he had perfected
were well worth the journey. His innovations in the manufacture
of arms formed as great an epoch in mechanical history as had
his invention of the cotton gin.</p>

<p>Jigs and fixtures were among his equipment; and it is altogether
probable that milling machines were also in use, since he must have
had practical knowledge of the utility of the milling cutter at this
time, as it is generally assumed that the first practical use of the milling
machine was in the making of parts of muskets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>The buildings which Mr. Whitney erected for his use were substantial
stone structures, and stand in a part of the city called in his
honor "Whitneyville." They form a part of the extensive plant of the
Winchester Repeating Arms Company.</p>

<p>At this point and at this early day, therefore, was inaugurated
the modern system of interchangeable manufacturing&mdash;or the manufacturing,
in large numbers, of duplicate parts, within such a limited
degree of variation as to admit of their ready interchangeability with
one another. The system was not one that would be confined to the
manufacture of arms, but was adaptable to the production of all kinds
of small and moderate-sized machinery, and was the initial effort
which in due time revolutionized the then existing shop methods,
and which has since built up the American system of manufacturing
to the proud distinction of being superior to anything of the kind in
other manufacturing countries.</p>

<p>In the operations of modern manufacturing, the principal object
sought is to turn out the product economically and accurately. To
produce these results economically, the parts must be produced very
rapidly. To produce them rapidly, not only must there be a very
complete and efficient equipment of machines, attachments, tools,
jigs, fixtures, and gauges or measuring devices, but there must also
be a very complete system of shop methods by which the operation
of this equipment is carried on.</p>

<p>It has been well said that "the man in whose brain the manufacturing
system was born was he who first took a piece of scrap iron
and drilled two holes in it, to guide a drill in making another piece
with two holes in it the same distance apart as in the first piece." The
men who now fill our drafting rooms and tool rooms, and who devise
and construct tools for the production of interchangeable metal parts,
are his descendants. They have made possible the manufacture of
the breech-loading gun, the typewriter, the cheap sewing machine,
the cash register, the machine-made watch, the automobile, as well as a
thousand and one other mechanical articles, machines, and devices
which form an integral part of our twentieth-century civilization.</p>

<p>To render these systems efficient and economical for these purposes,
the work must be <i>repetition or duplicate work</i>. That is, there
must be very large numbers of each of the different parts; and to carry
out the scheme of operation for the division and subdivision of work;
a single operation on a large number of parts is performed; then the
work is handled again, perhaps in another machine, and another
operation is performed; and so on until the part is complete. Thus
a piece of comparatively simple form may require a large number of
separate and distinct operations to complete it. But, as each single
operation is performed by one operator, he may give his undivided
attention to the accuracy of that operation; hence very accurate work
can be produced.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>In the development of these systems, the work has continually
grown more and more complex, as have also the requirements as to
the buildings in which manufacturing work is performed, and as to
the equipment necessary to perform it. Conditions have been continually
changing; greater speed as well as greater accuracy in all
machine operations has been demanded; and a largely increased output
per employee has been required. So great and urgent has been
this demand that the employee of to-day will turn out from three to
ten times the volume of product of a given kind that he did only a
few years ago. Undoubtedly this result has been brought about in
great measure by the great improvement in machines, tools, and fixtures.
Much is also due to the use of tools composed of high-speed steel;
still more, to the employment of improved systems for handling work.</p>

<p>But all of these do not fully explain the enormous increase in
product per employee. This has been brought about by various
methods of shop management. One of these is the specialization
of operations and the division and subdivision of departments,
whereby each operator has a certain well-defined and very limited
number of operations to perform. These operations he performs
over and over, hundreds and sometimes thousands of times daily,
until he becomes so accustomed to each movement that the operations
are performed not only with great rapidity but also with great accuracy.
Still another factor in the question of individual output, is the efforts
that have been made through systems of premiums, bonus, and similar
methods of reward for individual effort when the output reaches or
exceeds a certain fixed limit. These rewards are not confined to the
operatives, but are often extended to the foremen, assistant foremen,
gang bosses, and others of the "non-productive" force who have indirectly
contributed to the efficiency of individuals and hence to
departmental efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>In the succeeding articles, these matters will be taken up and
treated in detail, giving the actual practice as now prevailing in some
of the best organized manufacturing plants.</p>

<h3 class="p2">MACHINE SHOP MANAGEMENT</h3>

<p><b>Modern Meaning of Shop Management.</b> The present understanding
of the term <i>Shop Management</i> is quite different from the
sense in which it was used years ago. Formerly the management of
the shop was vested in a <i>superintendent</i> whose duties consisted in purchasing
material, inspecting it when it was received, turning it over
to the foreman, and in a general way looking after the work as it was
being performed. In addition to these duties, he frequently handled
the selling of the product, the collection of accounts, and the proper
provision for meeting the pay-roll on pay-days. He also had a
general supervision over the grounds and buildings and their care and
maintenance, as well as the provision for power, lighting, and heating.
By this arrangement of duties, it will be seen that comparatively little
time was devoted to actual shop operations, and much time to different
lines of duties that might more economically and often quite as
efficiently be performed by assistants at a much lower rate of pay.</p>

<p>In the modern methods of shop management, all these things
are changed. The specialization of workmanship, the division of
duties, the limiting of responsibilities&mdash;each restricted within narrow
limits by sharply defined regulations&mdash;have reduced the variety of
operations of the workman, and of responsibilities and duties of the
men who direct manufacturing work.</p>

<p>We find the purchasing of material and supplies in charge of a
<i>Purchasing Agent</i>. We find these purchases checked by a <i>Receiving
Clerk</i>, turned over to a <i>Storekeeper</i>, and subject to examination by a
regular <i>Inspector</i>. They are then put into the storeroom, whence
they are drawn as needed for the different departments, the foremen
of which sign definite orders for such kinds, quantities, and qualities
as may be needed, specifying the purposes for which they are to be
used or the particular orders to which they are to be charged. When
issued, they are receipted for by the person receiving them. All this
is conducted with the same regard for business rules as if the foreman
were making a purchase on his own account and paying for the goods.
We find the selling of the product in the hands of an expert <i>Sales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Manager</i>, often assisted by a corps of engineers, draftsmen, bookkeepers,
and clerks, numbering more persons than the entire factory's
force of non-producers twenty years previously. A <i>Credit and Collection
Department</i> attends to all collections, and the <i>Treasurer</i> and
<i>Cashier</i> see to it that the money for the pay-roll is on hand when
wanted. A <i>Production Engineer</i> regulates the volume of work going
into the shop, and the sequence of mechanical operations by which each
piece or part is to be machined and perfected. An assistant to the
Superintendent looks after the condition and maintenance of grounds
and buildings, yards, and the transportation facilities of the plant.</p>

<p>By these developments of the system of management into a
division of duties and responsibilities, the time, attention, and abilities
of the Superintendent may be devoted to his legitimate purposes of
<i>superintendence</i> or <i>supervision</i>, planning and directing the work of the
assistants and heads of departments.</p>

<p><b>A Typical Manufacturing Plant.</b> For the purpose of taking up
the question of Management in a systematic and practical manner,
we must first assume that we have a shop to manage; and secondly,
that it is of the usual type of manufacturing plant, built, organized,
and managed at the present day. The plan of such a plant is given
in Fig. 1.</p>

<p>In planning a plant of this character, provision must primarily be
made for the various departments for the following purposes:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">1. An <i>Engineering Department</i>, wherein the machines forming the
product may be designed and the drawings made for the various classes of
mechanics who are to perform the work of turning out the product.</p>

<p class="pbq">2. A <i>Pattern-Making Department</i>, in which the necessary patterns are
made for use in the foundry for producing the castings.</p>

<p class="pbq">3. A <i>Forge Shop</i>, capable of producing such forgings as are required in
the machinery to be built.</p>

<p class="pbq">4. An <i>Iron and Brass Foundry</i>, in which may be produced the rough
castings of the parts that are to enter into the machines constituting the
product.</p>

<p class="pbq">5. <i>Manufacturing Departments</i>, in which all parts (large and small) of
the product are made from the rough stock&mdash;such as castings, forgings, bar
stock, and the like, to the completed parts ready for assembling.</p>

<p class="pbq">6. <i>Assembling and Erecting Departments</i>, in which individual parts may
be assembled into groups of related parts, and these erected into complete
machines.</p>

<p class="pbq">7. A <i>Power Plant</i>, containing the proper equipment for furnishing the
necessary power for driving the machinery in these various departments, and
for providing lighting and heating facilities for the plant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">The <i>General Office</i> of the concern is of course understood; but, as it cannot
properly be classed with departments of the plant, it is not included in the
above enumeration.</p>

<p class="p1">In addition to the above list of principal departments, there will
be the following&mdash;quite as necessary, but secondary in importance:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">1. The <i>Transportation System</i>, including shop and yard tracks and cars,
elevators, cranes, hoists, and all similar appliances for handling material.</p>

<p class="pbq">2. The <i>Tool Room</i>, for making tools, jigs, and fixtures, and for properly
storing them in a convenient manner for issuing when they are called for.</p>

<p class="pbq">3. An <i>Experimental Room</i>, which all progressive concerns find necessary
in the development of their product.</p>

<p class="pbq">4. The <i>Store-Room</i>, in which are stored the raw material and the purchased
stock, either partly or completely manufactured, which are issued to
the different departments as needed for their daily routine work.</p>

<p class="pbq">5. The <i>Finished Parts Store-Room</i>, in which the smaller parts of the
product, as fast as they are completed, are stored and held until wanted for
the process of assembling.</p>

<p class="pbq">6. The <i>Pattern Storage Room</i>. In this department, often occupying
several floors of a building specially constructed for this purpose, are stored
all patterns for the iron and brass foundries, and also those sent to outside
foundries for malleable and steel castings.</p>

<p class="pbq">7. The <i>Carpenter Shop</i>. This is a general utility department making
boxes and crates for shipping; doing carpenter work in keeping the grounds
and buildings in proper repair, and making necessary changes therein; making
and repairing flasks for the foundry; and similar work.</p>

<p class="pbq">8. The <i>Paint Shop</i>. A small room serving little more than as a storeroom
for paints and painters' materials, as their work is principally done at
various points in the shops, wherever the machines or parts may happen to be.</p>

<p class="pbq">9. The <i>Shipping Room</i>. In a plant building large machinery, the
shipping room is simply an office for the shipper, the physical work of shipping
being done in the shops, wherever the machine may happen to be at the time.</p>

<p class="p1">Referring to the plan given in Fig. 1, it will be seen that the
Administration Building is placed in substantially the center of the
front line of the plant. The first and second floors of such a building
are usually devoted to administrative, commercial, and accounting
purposes. The upper floor is usually occupied by the Engineering
Department and drafting room.</p>

<p>The three Manufacturing Buildings numbered 1, 2, and 3 are
devoted to the various operations of making the parts of which the
machinery product is composed. These parts are then sent to the
Erecting Building (No. 4).</p>

<p>The system of shop transportation consists primarily of shop
tracks and cars, and is extended to the yard, being so designed as to
connect all buildings of the plant with one another and with the yard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
It also reaches the railroad tracks at numerous points. Overhead
traveling cranes cover the manufacturing buildings, and extend into
the erecting building far enough to form a connection with the large
traveling crane serving it, by which the large parts of machines are
carried from place to place as may be required by the erecting men.
This crane serves to load the finished machines upon the railroad cars,
when they are to be shipped, the railroad track being extended within
the building for this purpose, as shown in Fig. 1.</p>

<p>The Tool Room is given as central a location as possible, and
would naturally be near the junction of building No. 2 with the erecting
building.</p>

<p>The Experimental Room has no particular place, but is frequently
so placed as to be away from the active manufacturing
operations, with which it is liable to interfere if too closely related.</p>

<p>The general Store-Room for purchased material may be in the
erecting building, but is frequently located, for convenience of communication,
nearer the general offices&mdash;as for instance, in front of
building No. 1.</p>

<p>The smaller parts are stored in a Finished Parts Store-Room,
usually located in this building. Thence they are issued to the Assembling
Department as required.</p>

<p>The Pattern Shop building will often be composed of three floors.
On the ground floor will be the Carpenter Shop and flask making and
repairing work. On the second floor will be the pattern-making shop,
and on the third floor will be the pattern storage rooms. A large
elevator serves all three floors.</p>

<p>The Paint Shop is sometimes located in one of the manufacturing
buildings or the erecting building; but as the painting of machine
parts and complete machines is generally done in any one of the
departments where the work may be, and the paint shop is hardly
more than a storeroom for paints, a due consideration of the question
of fire protection would indicate that it had better be placed in a small
building entirely detached from all manufacturing buildings.</p>

<p>The Power House, in the former method of transmitting power
by shafting and belting, was located as nearly as possible in the center
of the space over which power was to be distributed. Since the
advent of electricity and its common use for transmitting power, the
question of the location of the power house is relieved from this condition;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
it may be located at the point most convenient to railroad
facilities for receiving fuel, or for obtaining the necessary water for
boilers, for fire purposes, etc.</p>

<p>In a plant manufacturing small machines or a kind of product
which is shipped in small quantities, it is obvious that the Shipping
Room must be convenient to the point from which these goods are to
be taken by railroad cars, by boat, or by teams. If most of the shipping
is of large machines or articles which must be handled by cranes,
the railroad tracks will be run into the erecting building, and the
machines loaded there, in order to avoid the expense of extra handling
and moving them. This is the arrangement shown in Fig. 1. In
this case the shipping room may be in the Administration Building,
so as to be convenient to the other office departments. In some kinds
of business it is convenient to have the shipping room and general
storeroom near each other, as there is considerable business done in
each that is quite closely related to the other.</p>

<p>The Iron and Brass Foundry is usually located at some distance
from the manufacturing buildings, in order that the latter may be as
free as possible from the annoyance of smoke and dust. It is connected
with the other departments by the system of shop and yard
tracks, and the railroad siding track passes through one end of the
building as a matter of convenience in shipping castings. There is
also a branch track running along the side of the foundry building
for the purpose of delivering coke, coal, moulding sand, pig iron,
scrap iron, and other foundry materials.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the buildings shown in the plan are
located in a compact mass, with considerably less than the usual
yard room. In this instance, however, the plan was so drafted to
economize space on the drawing. It is the law in some European
countries that not over 50 per cent of the area of a manufacturing site
shall be covered by roofs. Such a law would be of much value in this
country, to prevent the crowding of buildings to such an extent as to
be unhealthful to employees.</p>

<p>While factory buildings are frequently erected of from three to
to six floors, the modern tendency is to reduce the number of floors
in all shops and manufacturing buildings; and in the case of machine
shops, a large majority of them are built of only one floor. Some,
however, have wide galleries at the side, by which considerable second-floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
space is added; while the central portion remains open to the
roof, and supplies ample space for the accommodation of the overhead
traveling crane, as well as the necessary added height needed for
erecting large machinery.</p>

<p>Foundries are necessarily built of a single floor, although there
are several in different parts of the country where moulding rooms are
located as high as the third floor. This latter arrangement is usually
made for brass moulding, rather than for iron moulding.</p>

<p><b>Organization of a Manufacturing Plant.</b> Having the design of
the plant, and assuming that the required buildings have been erected
in accordance with this plan, the next step will be to organize the
management both in a general way and also as relates to the various
departments usually necessary to inaugurate the business of manufacturing.</p>

<p>As the scope of this treatise covers only the shop and its management,
we need not take up the commercial organization of the company
by which it is capitalized and maintained. We shall therefore
consider the General Manager as the head of the organization, and
proceed to examine the methods usually adopted for the division of
authority and responsibilities from him to the actual workmen at the
bench, at the machines, and on the floors.</p>

<p>The chart shown in Fig. 2 illustrates the plan of the organization.
Nearly all minor officials and office employees, such as bookkeepers,
clerks, stenographers, etc., are omitted from this chart, to avoid confusion
and to simplify the understanding of the organization plan
and its numerous details.</p>

<p>The General Manager has a personal Assistant, and, for his commercial
affairs, the service of a commercial Accountant and a Cashier.
Other office employees are similar in number, duties, and responsibilities
to those in the usual commercial office.</p>

<p>By referring to the chart, it will be seen that the organization is
divided into two distinctly different parts. First, that of <i>production</i>
or <i>manufacturing proper</i>; and second, that of <i>selling</i> or <i>marketing</i>
the output produced.</p>

<p>In this case the production division is by far the most numerous
and complex. This, however, is not always the case&mdash;as, for instance,
in the case of a manufacturing concern selling its product through
local agents. Frequently the territory over which sales are made is
divided along state lines, and a <i>District Agent</i> appointed for each state.
These, in turn, appoint the <i>Local Agents</i>. This necessitates an
organization of hundreds of local agents, supervised by state or district
agents, and these in turn by a <i>General Agent</i>. Thus a very large
organization is built up for disposing of the product.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Another plan is the employment of <i>Traveling Canvassers</i>, each
having a certain territory to cover, who make their reports to either
state or district agents, or to the general agent located at a central
point&mdash;sometimes at the factory, but not necessarily so.</p>

<p>As competition becomes stronger and net profits smaller, the
problem of marketing the product becomes more and more important;
greater and more complex selling organizations are necessary; and
the expense of selling increases. The advertising organization, or
what has come to be known as the <i>Publicity Department</i>, is a most
important adjunct to the modern manufacturing business; and large
amounts of money are annually expended in its maintenance.</p>

<p>In the case under consideration, the selling of the product is in
charge of a <i>Sales Manager</i>, who has as his office staff the <i>Publicity
Manager</i>; the <i>Preliminary Engineer</i>, and the draftsmen and estimators
who assist him; the <i>General Salesman</i>, who is in reality the personal
assistant to the Sales Manager; and the <i>Credit and Collection
Clerk</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Publicity Manager</i>, sometimes called the <i>Advertising
Manager</i>, has charge of all advertising of whatever kind, demonstrations
at expositions and at agencies, and, in fact, all work that
may be properly comprised under the term "publicity"&mdash;that is,
keeping the public informed as to the product of the company and
its adaptability to meet the needs of the public in the special lines it
manufactures.</p>

<p>The <i>Preliminary Engineer</i> is in charge of such engineering matters
as are necessary upon new work, or work upon which the Sales
Manager desires to estimate. It frequently happens that considerable
designing and drawing are necessary in this connection, previous
to definite orders being given or contracts signed. It often happens
that the product of the concern must be changed in certain details
so as to adapt it to the uses of various customers, to the different local
conditions under which it is to be used, and to the various purposes
for which it is to be used. In case an order is given and contracts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
signed, the preliminary drawings thus produced become a part of the
transaction, and are used by the Production Department in getting
out the machinery to fill the order.</p>

<p>The purpose of the <i>Credit and Collection Office</i> is to canvass the
financial standing of customers and prospective customers; to make
collections when necessary to do so; and generally to advise the Sales
Manager on these important matters. The official in charge of this
office is frequently called the <i>Credit Man</i>, and must be a person of
peculiar ability in his special line in order to protect the concern from
fraud, imposition, and financial losses when dealing with customers
of commonly unknown or doubtful financial ability and standing.</p>

<p>The Production Division is under charge of the <i>Factory Manager</i>,
who has for his personal assistant a <i>Production Engineer</i> or <i>Superintendent</i>,
who plans the productive scheme of the factory and supervises
the departmental distribution of the work and the shop operations
necessary for the routine work upon it. In a large manufacturing
establishment, the Production Engineer will be at the head of a considerable
force of draftsmen and clerks comprising what is sometimes
called the <i>Planning Department</i>, which arranges all operations, shop
routine, time schedules, premium rates, and similar matters. The
Factory Manager will also have the usual office assistants, and have
direct control of the <i>Purchasing Department</i>, the <i>Time and Cost
Department</i>, the <i>General Store-Room</i>, and the <i>Shipping Room</i>. In
some concerns the Time and Cost Department is a part of the Planning
Department, as the records of this department cover nearly every kind
of information required for the Time and Cost systems.</p>

<p>All other departments of the factory are divided into two general
classes. The first comprises the general departments, as follows:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">The Engineering Department, or Drafting Room.</p>

<p class="pbq">The Experimental and Development Department.</p>

<p class="pbq">The Power Plant, for both the generation and the distribution of power.</p>

<p class="pbq">The Iron and Brass Foundries.</p>

<p class="pbq">The Forge Shop and Cutting-Off Rooms.</p>

<p class="pbq">The Carpenter Shop (including sometimes the Flask Making and Repairing
Departments).</p>

<p class="pbq">The Paint Shop and Painters' Supply Room.</p>

<p class="pbq">The Transportation Department for shops and yards.</p>

<p class="p1">These are under the supervision of the General Superintendent,
who has charge of all mechanical matters except those strictly pertaining
to production or to the actual manufacturing of the product.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The second general class is that of Production, and will ordinarily
consist of the following departments:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">The Planing Department, including shapers and slotters.</p>

<p class="pbq">The Drilling and Boring Department, including vertical, horizontal, and
radial drills and boring machines.</p>

<p class="pbq">The Heavy Turning Department, including lathes of less than 24-inch
swing.</p>

<p class="pbq">The Milling Machine Department, including horizontal, vertical, and
special milling machines, profile machines, etc.</p>

<p class="pbq">The Gear-Cutting Department, for the making of all classes of gears.</p>

<p class="pbq">The Grinding Department, including cylindrical, disc, and surface
grinding.</p>

<p class="pbq">The Polishing Department, which includes polishing, buffing, etc.</p>

<p class="pbq">The Assembling Department, in which parts (usually comparatively
small) are assembled in groups of related parts and stored, pending the final
erection of the machines.</p>

<p class="pbq">The Erecting Department, in which the entire machine is erected and
usually tested, and inspected, receiving the final painting and other finishing
work ready for shipping.</p>

<p class="pbq">Should the character of the product be such as to require it, there will
be also a Plating Department, usually located adjoining the Polishing Department.</p>

<p class="p1">This class of departments will be under the direct supervision of
the <i>Production Superintendent</i>.</p>

<p>Each department is in charge of a <i>Foreman</i>, who is responsible
for the discipline, the work, and the efficiency of the force under him.
Frequently the department is large enough to require one or more
assistant foremen. Under these may also be <i>Gang Bosses</i>, each of
whom will have a small force of employees, called <i>gangs</i>, for whose
work and efficiency he is responsible.</p>

<p><b>Shop Management.</b> Referring to the Chart, Fig. 2, it will be
noticed that the rectangular figures representing different offices,
departments, or officials are connected by lines. These are commonly
called <i>lines of authority</i>, and a careful study of them will show
in what manner and through what channels the orders of an official
pass to the employees for whose work he is responsible.</p>

<p>Tracing these lines from the head of the establishment through
the various offices and officials to the different departments, we get a
fundamental idea of <i>Shop Management</i>.</p>

<p>This system will be rendered somewhat simpler by reference to
the Chart, Fig. 3, which shows the path or official channel of communication
and authority from the Superintendent down to the workmen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
It also emphasizes the fundamental idea of all official business
passing through the officials in charge of intermediate departments.</p>

<p>Thus, if the Factory Manager desires a certain thing done, he does
not give the order to one of the workmen, nor to a foreman, but to the
Superintendent. The Superintendent will give his orders to the
foreman of the department wherein the work is to be done. If this
is a department in which there are gang bosses, the Foreman will give
his orders to the proper gang boss, who will select a suitable workman,
or as many of them as may be necessary, and instruct them as to the
work, and will personally see that it is performed promptly and in the
proper manner. When the work is completed, he will report the fact
to the foreman, who will in turn report to the Superintendent, who
informs the Factory Manager that his orders have been executed.</p>

<p>This process may seem unnecessarily complicated, and in consequence
it is sometimes referred to as <i>red tape</i>. It is, however, necessary
to have a well-defined and properly understood system and channel
for all routine business, some of the reasons for which are as
follows:</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><i>First</i>&mdash;it has been said that "no man can serve two masters," and this
is quite true in all questions of shop management. Every loyal workman has
learned by precept and tradition to look to his immediate superior for all
orders and instructions relating to his work, and he naturally and properly
resents any attempt to ignore or belittle his legitimate "boss."</p>

<p class="pbq"><i>Second</i>&mdash;As the efficiency of the workmen depends to a great extent upon
their loyalty to the management, and as that loyalty can be secured and maintained
only by a spirit of justice and fair-dealing to all, including officials and
workmen, all authority and responsibility should be sharply defined and
properly limited, to the end that the business and work may proceed in an
orderly and efficient manner; that all officials and workmen may know when
they are within their proper limit of rights; and doing their duties without
fear of overstepping their due bounds or interfering with the rights and privileges
of their fellows.</p>

<p class="p1">Nearly all rules are subject to some exceptions, and the above
have theirs. The discipline of the shop, or what is sometimes referred
to as the <i>police regulations</i>, are expected to be enforced by <i>all officials
at all times</i>.</p>

<p>Two of these exceptions are of such a general nature and application
that they are here noted.</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><i>First</i>&mdash;Any official noticing an infraction of the discipline of the plant
may call the attention of the employee offending, without regard to the department
in which he works, and require him at once to cease violating the rules.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
But the official should, as soon as possible, report the matter to the head of
the department in which the offending employee works.</p>

<p class="pbq"><i>Second</i>&mdash;Any official noticing work being wrongly done, or material
wasted, or machinery obviously injured, or the safety of the workmen, the
building, or the machinery endangered, may peremptorily order the action to
cease, and at once report
the fact to the
head of the department
or to the Superintendent,
as he
may judge proper.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Official Communications.</b>
For
ordinary communications
other
than General or
Special Orders,
Production Orders,
letters, etc.,
a written form
should be habitually
used. The
usual form is
shown in Fig. 4.
These forms are
put up in pads of
alternate sheets of
white and light-tinted
paper, the
former being perforated
at the top
so as to be readily
torn out while the
tinted sheet remains fast at the stub. Both sheets are printed with
the same form, and all are serially numbered in pairs of one white
and one tinted sheet. Carbon paper is used, the white sheet being
written upon and the tinted one receiving the carbon impression.
Each official is supplied with these pads, and by their use he always
retains a copy of any memorandum or communication he makes to
another official or department. The serial numbers are intended to
aid in the identification of any memorandum that may have become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
somewhat illegible. The use of these blanks saves any misunderstanding
that might occur from giving and receiving verbal orders;
and serves to prevent errors and mistakes, and to fix the responsibility
for their occurrence upon the party in error.</p>

<p><b>Successful Management.</b> The spirit of shop management should
always be a spirit of <i>leadership</i>. This cannot usually be obtained
unless the manager possesses natural ability as a leader. Successful
military chieftains are examples of this condition. They <i>lead</i> the men
instead of <i>driving</i> them, and the result is a condition of enthusiastic
loyalty.</p>

<p>It is also quite as necessary that a leader should be a practical
man with sound technical training and practical experience in the
business which he undertakes to manage. If he is not thus equipped
for his duties, the facts soon become apparent to his subordinates,
and his reputation suffers accordingly. The workmen lose
confidence in his leadership, and lack enthusiasm in the performance
of their duties, going about their work in a listless and perfunctory
manner that is very detrimental to the efficiency of the plant.</p>

<p>Still another quality necessary in the successful manager, is the
ability to judge men and their capacities for various duties. To get
always the right man for the position, the machine, or the job, is a
valuable trait in any man who is to direct the work of even a moderate-sized
establishment. The larger the plant and the more diversified
the business carried on in it, the more valuable and indispensable this
characteristic will become. The manager who is continually or
frequently changing his subordinate officials, and consequently producing
changes in the working force, will always find his duties arduous,
and will also find it well-nigh impossible to get the plant up to the
degree of efficiency that is to be reasonably expected. The volume
of output will continually fall below the normal point, and the quality
of the work will also deteriorate. The work of management should
be a constant upbuilding of the force, and of development and education
along the lines of advancement in the special output of the concern.
This cannot be carried on if the composition of the force, or
the officials who handle it, are in a transition state of change, doubt,
and uncertainty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>There is, on the part of many officials having charge of men, a
propensity to interfere too much with workmen and their work, and
thus to hinder rather than help them. While it is quite true that every
official from the Gang Boss up to the Factory Manager can, at various
times, help the workmen in their allotted tasks by timely advice and
suggestions, it is also true that this is a matter that can be easily overdone,
until it becomes an annoying nuisance and unnecessarily interferes
with the men in the discharge of their legitimate duties.</p>

<p>Workmen are quick to discern when suggestions and advice are
well meant and instructive, and when they come as a kind of veiled
criticism. The official who permits himself to indulge in this sort of
dictation soon falls into a practice of <i>nagging</i> that is most exasperating
to the men. It is a practice that first weakens and then destroys the
official's influence with the men, who obey only from necessity.
When this condition exists, the working efficiency of the force is at a
very low ebb.</p>

<p>On the other hand, really helpful advice and suggestions, made
in a cheerful manner and from a quite apparent desire to assist workmen,
will usually meet with a quick and loyal response that argues
well for the efficiency of the workmen.</p>

<p>Another point on the road to success, is a patient and interested
listening to suggestions that workmen have to make, even though it is
on trivial matters. It should always be borne in mind that the workman
laboring day after day on the same class, and often on the same
kind of pieces, of work, is in a position to discern and to study out
many minor improvements in tools and methods which are valuable.
A kindly hearing accorded him, the adoption of such suggestions as
are practical, with some substantial reward for his study, will encourage
not only him but other workmen to study their work and
endeavor to find better and more efficient ways of doing it. Thus an
active and interested spirit of loyalty is brought about that is one of
the most valuable assets of the plant.</p>

<p>The successful manager is he who is enabled to <i>unite</i> his working
force of subordinate officials and workmen in a complete and loyal
organization, all working for the common good and for the success
and prosperity of the concern. Having gained this condition, the
question of efficient and economical manufacturing is practically as
well as theoretically solved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p2">SHOP METHODS AND RECORDS</h3>

<p>From the principles that have been advanced in connection with
the subjects of Manufacturing and Shop Management, it will be
readily seen that the work of the manufacturing plant of the present
day is a very complex matter, and there must necessarily be very complete
and carefully formulated plans and systems by which all its
operations are regulated, and a somewhat elaborate plan of records
by which these operations and their results are recorded and filed.</p>

<p>In formulating the necessary plans for the methods and records
of a manufacturing establishment, we must first determine the requirements
of the work and decide definitely on what we wish to accomplish.
In other words, the conditions must be first examined and
analyzed, their various factors studied at their true value, and the
requirements determined, so that a general plan of operations may be
followed.</p>

<p>These methods shall cover the following subjects:</p>

<p class="pnr05 p1">1. The selection and employment of workmen.<br />
2. The methods of keeping the time of all employees.<br />
3. The manner of paying workmen.<br />
4. The ordering of work into the shops.<br />
5. The routine of passing work through the shops.<br />
6. The method of drawing stock and materials.<br />
7. The ways of keeping and issuing tools.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Importance of Records.</b> Each of these methods will become a
part of the routine of the establishment, and the operations carried
on under it will be proper matters for regular records made from day
to day.</p>

<p>Such records are exceedingly valuable as current information,
and, when properly filed, become quite as valuable for reference in the
future as for use in current operations.</p>

<p>In all improvements in the working routine of manufacturing
operations, there should be previous records by which the present
performances may be checked and compared. By this arrangement,
it is comparatively easy to ascertain whether or not any improvement
is being made, and in what direction it is being made. This knowledge
will suggest further plans and betterments. Should the records
prove that there are losses rather than gains being made, the warning
is equally valuable, and we make haste to better results and greater
efficiency in the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, whether the plans and methods in use are really successful,
or quite the reverse, it is of the utmost importance that we should
know by prompt and accurate records just what the results are, in
order to keep in close touch with the progress of events, and that,
when plans do not produce the favorable results expected and desired,
the information may be promptly available, the warning be heard, and
plans altered or amended until they bring about a successful routine
in the manufacturing operations.</p>

<p><b>Selection and Employment of Workmen.</b> This is an important
matter, since it costs money to introduce new men in any business,
and requires from a day or two to several weeks for the new man to
become sufficiently accustomed to his work and surroundings to be of
the same value as the man who is perfectly familiar with the shop, the
routine and methods of work, and the foreman under whom he works.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-248.jpg" width="400" height="247"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 5. Application Card.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is therefore necessary to go about this matter in a methodical
manner, and to keep records of:</p>

<p class="pnr05 p1">(<i>a</i>) All persons making application for employment.<br />
(<i>b</i>) All persons regularly accepted as employees.<br />
(<i>c</i>) Individual records of all regular workmen.<br />
(<i>d</i>) All employees who leave the employment of the company.</p>

<p class="p1">To accomplish these results, the official whose duty it is to employ
men will fill out, or will have a clerk fill out, an <i>Application Card</i> of the
form shown in Fig. 5, for each person applying for a position. It will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
be noticed that it is important to know whether the applicant has ever
been employed in this establishment previous to the present application.
If so, his record can be readily referred to for information as
to the desirability of employing him again. It is also necessary that the
record of his last employer be known, and frequently of the employer
previous to the last, as these matters will also be taken into consideration
in determining his fitness for the position for which he applies.
It is also necessary to know how many years he has been employed in
manufacturing establishments, as this fact, taken in consideration
with his age, will frequently furnish information upon which to base
judgment as to his fitness.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-249.jpg" width="400" height="246"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 6. Employment Card.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Application Card, being on file, is available for the use of
such foremen or other officials as may be in need of workmen. Should
the applicant be decided to be available, after consultation between
the official to whom application was made and the foreman desiring
to increase his force, the applicant will be sent for, and employed at a
rate mutually satisfactory, and an <i>Employment Card</i> of the form shown
in Fig. 6 filled out. This will repeat some of the information contained
on the Application Card; but it is necessary to have two cards
in any event, as the information must be filed in separate drawers.</p>

<p>The Employment Card will also give the name of the official
employing the man, as well as that of the foreman under whom he is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
work, the kind of work he is to perform, and when he is to commence
work. It will also require the approval of the Superintendent or
Factory Manager, as the case may be, to make it valid and operative.</p>

<p>The applicant having become one of the regular employees of the
concern, a third card is made out for filing in the <i>List of Employees</i>
drawer. This will be upon the form shown in Fig. 7, and is called a
<i>Service Card</i>. It will be noticed that each of these three cards is
headed with the name and address of the person whom it represents.</p>

<p>The Service Card gives the department in which the employee is
to work, the kind of work which he is to do, the date he begins work,
and his rate of pay. Spaces are also provided for noting the amount
and date of any increases in his rate, and for the record of a transfer
to another department should he be moved, as is frequently the case
with new men who may not be quite adaptable to the kind of work
first attempted, but entirely satisfactory at some other class of work.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-250.jpg" width="400" height="247"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 7. Service Card.</p>
</div></div>

<p>A space is also provided for noting the date of the workman's
leaving the employ of the company, and also for giving the reason for
it. This will be valuable information in case the workman should subsequently
apply for employment. When an employee leaves the
service of the company, his Service Card is removed from the List of
Employees drawer, and placed in a fourth drawer labeled <i>Discharged
or Quit</i>, being held there for future reference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Individual Record of Standing.</b> In many well-conducted manufacturing
establishments, it is customary to keep a record of the standing
of the men as rated each month, as a valuable reference in cases
of proposed promotion, increases in pay, reliability for special work
and positions of responsibility. Various methods of marking the
records of the men each month have been tried, but the simplest
method is to use the number 100 for perfect, and to divide it as follows:</p>

<table id="t13" summary="t13">

 <tr>
  <td>Good workmanship</td>
  <td class="tdr">50</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Punctuality in reporting for work</td>
  <td class="tdr">30</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Deportment during working hours</td>
  <td class="tdr">20</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdr">&mdash;&mdash;</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdc">Total</td>
  <td class="tdr">100</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-251.jpg" width="400" height="251"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 8. Individual Record Card.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Demerits are marked off as to workmanship, by the foreman,
according to his judgment aided by the Inspector's reports of the work
done by the man.</p>

<p>Punctuality is judged by the number of times late, each instance
reducing the mark by one unit. As the workman enters the shop
twice a day, morning and afternoon, assuming 26 working days in the
month, a practical disregard of punctuality soon reduces his record
in this respect to zero.</p>

<p>Deportment is judged by the Foreman, who also takes into account
occasions on which the workman may have been reported for
violating the regulations in this respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>A <i>Record Card</i> is shown in Fig. 8, upon which monthly records
are kept. The total for any period, divided by the number of months
covered by the record, will give the percentage of a perfect record.
This card provides for a record for two years.</p>

<p>If it seems advisable to do so for special reasons, a similar card
may be formulated covering the six working days of the week. A
year's record in this form may be entered on a card 4 by 6 inches, by
arranging the horizontal and vertical ruling for that purpose.</p>

<p>Such a record may be profitably kept of the work of the office
force, as well as of the men in the shops. It will be valuable in many
ways in judging of the availability of the men for special work, as well
as for promotion.</p>

<p>Necessarily such records should be very carefully kept; otherwise
there is liable to be serious injury done to the working reputation and
integrity, as well as reliability, of the men.</p>

<p><b>The Employment Agent.</b> In large concerns, an official is regularly
appointed as an Employment Agent, and it is his duty to keep
the office and the shops supplied with competent men engaged at
reasonable wages. He must therefore keep in close and accurate
touch with the labor market, for the same reasons that the purchasing
agent must know the state of the market for material and supplies.
He must know how and where to reach workmen of the different classes
whenever he is called upon to furnish them.</p>

<p>While ordinary laborers may nearly always be obtained from the
daily applications made at the office, skilled men must be hunted up;
and it is not usually easy to find just the man with the qualifications
desired.</p>

<p>When men are wanted for positions above the average skilled
workmen, the best and most promising will be nearly always distributed
among the present employees who are deserving of advancement. To
promote one of them, rather than hire some man from outside the
organization, is usually good business policy. The man and his
abilities are generally well known, while a stranger is always an unknown
quantity. The men, being acquainted with the man, will be
pleased to see him get the deserved promotion; and it is always wise
to consider the popularity of proposed orders affecting the working
force. The man himself will feel his added responsibilities much
more than an outside man will, and will generally work harder to succeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
in his new position. Therefore it is always best to give the first
chance to present employees who have been faithful to the responsibilities
thus far placed upon them.</p>

<p>It will be found that in most of the departments there are employees
who from one reason or another are doing work quite below
their real capacity, hoping that later on there may be better opportunities
for the coveted position. The Employment Agent should know
the men of the force, and their abilities, so as to take advantage of these
conditions. A man may be needed by a foreman in one department
who is not aware that in a neighboring department may be just the
kind of man he wants. The Employment Agent should know where
to find the man at once.</p>

<p>Again, one department may, from the condition of the work, be
short of help, and may request the Employment Agent to hire a certain
number of men of certain qualifications and abilities. At the same
time, there may be another department in which there are more men
than can be used to advantage. An arrangement for the temporary
or permanent transfer of some of these men will be a great help to both
departments, and will have the added advantage of keeping good men
permanently employed.</p>

<p>If a workman feels that his employment is permanent, and that
there are fair opportunities for advancement, this will be the surest
way to hold him faithful and loyal to the interests of the establishment;
and the conditions that bring about this condition of mind in him will
also draw other good men who will be glad to be counted as among those
faithful to a company which appreciates their services and which will
look to their interests as they consider those of their employers. The
result will be that these men will give their best services, and even be
on the alert to further the interests of the employer who has favored
them. Thus a strong working organization is built up, which becomes
one of the best and most valuable assets of the company.</p>

<p><b>Time Keeping.</b> As cost of labor is usually greater than any other
in the manufacturing plant, and frequently greater than all other
factors in the cost of manufacturing, it is very important that the
records pertaining to this expense be properly planned and accurately
kept.</p>

<p>Various methods have been adopted and used for this purpose.
Some of the more prominent plans will be given. They are each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
adapted to some certain kind or class of work, and it will often be
found that in practice still different forms must be devised in order to
meet the existing conditions.</p>

<p>There are three methods of recording the time of employees&mdash;namely:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">1. By entering the time in a book or upon cards, by a Time-Keeper.</p>

<p class="pbq">2. By entering the time upon cards by the workman himself.</p>

<p class="pbq">3. By stamping the time upon cards by the workman in a time-recording
clock.</p>

<p class="p1">The first of these methods is the oldest form, and has now to a
great extent gone out of use.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-254.jpg" width="400" height="249"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 9. Pattern Shop Time Card.</p>
</div></div>

<p>A large majority of the work of a manufacturing plant requires
that the time worked by the employees shall be registered
twice. That is, one entry shall be of the <i>day time</i> (time paid for <i>by the
day</i>), which necessitates the recording of the total number of hours
worked each day; the second entry shall record the <i>job time</i> (the time
worked upon the different jobs during the day). This second entry
is sometimes called <i>Time Distribution</i>, since the employee's time is
distributed over the different jobs upon which he has worked.</p>

<p><b>Time-Card Forms.</b> This work is sometimes done by means of
time cards as shown in Figs. 9, 10, 11, and 12, which are given as
characteristic examples of these methods. These cards are of different
tints as a convenient method of recognizing them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 9 is yellow, and is used in the Pattern Shop.</p>

<p>Fig. 10 is chocolate-colored, and is used in the Forge Shop.</p>

<p>Fig. 11 is blue, and is used by the Carpenters and Flask Makers.</p>

<p>Fig. 12 is white, and is used in the Machine Shop.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 11. Time Card for Carpenters and Flask Makers.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Similar card forms may be devised for any other department of a
plant, or for the departments of plants doing entirely different work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>When these cards are used as a means of distributing the time to
the various jobs or orders in force in the shop, the <i>day time</i>, from which
the pay-roll is made up, is usually recorded on a strip of paper in a
time clock, the operation being performed by each employee as he
passes into the shop morning and afternoon, and when leaving at
noon and night. Passing to the clock, the workman swings a lever
to his individual number, and presses in a knob, whereby the exact
time of the operation is recorded upon a slip of paper, a ribbon, or a
disc within the clock.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-256.jpg" width="400" height="245"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 12. Machine Shop Time Card.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In other forms of time clock, an individually numbered key is
inserted in one of the individually numbered holes, turned around, and
withdrawn. The time is recorded in a manner quite similar to that
used in the case just described above.</p>

<p>The four forms for time cards shown are quite similar, the difference
being in the list of operations given at the right-hand end of the
card.</p>

<p>At the top of the card are spaces for the date, order number,
workman's number, and the number of the machine upon which he
works (provided the work is done on a machine). In the next space,
the name of the department is given. This is followed by spaces for
the <i>quantity</i>&mdash;that is, the number of pieces, feet, or inches of such
material as is designated in this way, or the number of pounds in
weight of the material. Then comes a brief description of the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Opposite each of these is a square in which the workman can
indicate the particular kind of work he has been doing, by marking
an X. Thus the form shown in Fig. 9 contains the following classes
of work&mdash;namely, Pattern Making, meaning new pattern work;
Pattern Repairs, referring to repairs charged to the job; Foundry
Repairs, or repairs to patterns or fixtures the expense of which is to be
charged to the Foundry Department; Equipment Repairs, referring
to pattern shop equipment; General Office, consisting of small jobs
of equipment and maintenance that are better done by a pattern maker
than by a carpenter; Drafting Room, similar new work and repairs,
such as drafting boards, angles, etc.; Tool Room, similar work
chargeable to this department, such as boxes or cases for special tools,
and work not entrusted to a carpenter.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the kind of work the employee is engaged
upon, he checks it as described; and after the words "Time Started,"
he notes the hour and minute he begins work. When the job is
completed, he notes the time after the words "Time Stopped,"
The elapsed time, the rate, and the value are filled in by the time
clerk.</p>

<p>This card is turned in to the foreman or dropped in a box provided
for that purpose, it having been approved by the foreman of
the department in which the work is done. It then goes to the time
clerk.</p>

<p>As each workman has a card for each different job and for each
day, it follows that all the job cards for a single day must aggregate
the same amount of time as that indicated on the stamped record
within the recording time clock. Discrepancies of this kind are investigated,
and the time distribution readjusted until satisfactory, the
foreman of the department usually being consulted in the case.</p>

<p><b>Recording-Clock Time-Cards.</b> Recording time clocks are also
made which operate automatically to produce changes in the position
of the card dropped into a receptacle provided for the purpose, such,
that when a lever is manipulated, not only is the exact hour and
minute stamped upon the card, but it is stamped in its proper place
upon the card so as to correspond with the proper day of the week and
also indicate whether forenoon or afternoon. The horizontal changes
of position are made by hand, previous to manipulating the operating
lever.</p>

the employee. Following
the table prepared for the
time stampings, is a space
for the total time, the
rate, and the amount due
for the week.</p>

<p>The back of the card
is shown in Fig. 14, and
is plain except at the top,
which is printed in large
and plain type "This Side
Out," as employees are
liable to introduce the
card with its face outward.
For convenience
the employee's number
and name are given on this
side as well as on the face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>By the above method of time recording, <i>all</i> employees will use
the regular Day Time card. Such employees as work on the regular
production orders, and on work properly chargeable to them, will in
addition to the Day Time card use a Job Time card, of the form shown
in Fig. 15. This card is provided with spaces at the top for the order
number, date, employee's number, machine number, article or piece
upon which the work is being done, and the name of the operation
that is being performed. The body of the card has the same spaces
for the recording stampings. It will be noticed that the card shown
in Fig. 13 runs from Monday to Sunday, inclusive. This is the usual
form, but in some shops the fiscal week ends on different days of the
week. In the job card shown in Fig. 15, it ends on Thursday.</p>

<p>In the use of these job cards, a card is made out for each job or
order, without regard to the number of different jobs an employee may
have in a day. The aggregate of the time shown on all these cards
for a day must aggregate the amount shown on the day time card from
which the pay-roll is made up. Thus each card acts as a check on
the other, and accuracy is insured to a considerable degree.</p>

<p>When the work for which the job time is issued has been completed,
and the card receives its final stamping, it may be turned over
to the foreman, who will send it to the Time Clerk. This gives the
foreman an opportunity to look it over and correct any mistakes that
may have been made. In some shops the card is dropped into a box
marked <i>Job Time Cards&mdash;Completed</i>, whence it is gathered up with
others, by the Time Clerk. Coming into the possession of the Time
Clerk, he will check it up, together with such others as the workman
may have used on the same day, in order to ascertain if the total time
on the job cards for the day equals that shown on the day time card.</p>

<p>When the Time Clerk has compared the cards, he will send the
job cards to the Cost Clerk, who will enter the amounts in a <i>Job Time
Summary</i> book of the form shown in Fig. 16. On this blank, the
number, name, and rate of each man are written. The succeeding
columns are headed with the various current order numbers. Entries
are made opposite the man's name, of the pay-roll value of the time
he has worked on the various orders or jobs for the day. The total,
carried out in the extreme right-hand column, represents his pay for
the day. The totals at the bottom of the job columns represent the
value of the time spent on each order, for the day. The work is
checked as correct when the sum of all the totals of the right-hand
column is exactly equal to the sum of all the totals at the foot of the
columns.</p>

<p>The entries in this book are made by quite young clerks, who
handle only these job cards and books as their daily tasks, and who
become very expert, accurate, and rapid at this work. The totals are
carried by the Cost Clerk or one of his assistants to the <i>cost ledger</i>, in
which the costs of both labor and material, as well as all expense
charges, are brought together. Sometimes this work is done upon
cards, each one representing an order and containing in brief and condensed
form all the charges of whatever kind made against the order.</p>

<p><b>Methods of Paying Employees.</b> The methods by which pay-rolls
are made up and the employees paid, are important; and whatever
plans are adopted, they should realize the following desirable requirements:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">1. The record of amounts due the men should be absolutely accurate
and in accordance with the rates at which the men were employed, subject (<i>a</i>)
to such modifications as may be made by reason of properly authorized changes
in rate; (<i>b</i>) to such modifications as may be made from week to week by overtime
work, or by the operation of methods of "piece work," "premium work,"
or any of the several plans for rewarding exceptionally efficient work; (<i>c</i>) to
such deductions as may properly be made on account of advance payments
that have been made upon due authority.</p>

<p class="pbq">2. The methods of making up the pay-roll and paying the men should
secure promptness in this work, so that the pay of the employees may not be
held back for an unreasonable length of time pending the necessary clerical
work.</p>

<p class="pbq">3. The methods of payment should be such that no workman can know
the amount paid to any other workman.</p>

<p class="p1">To accomplish the results desired in the first requirement, if the
amounts due the men are made up from the time recorded by the men
themselves&mdash;that is, in a recording clock&mdash;is a comparatively easy
task, since it is principally a matter of mathematics, with a strict
attention to details.</p>

<p>Changes in rate of pay do not usually take effect until the week
following that in which the order is given. This order will be in the
form of a request by the foreman of the department in which the workman
is employed, stating the reasons for the increase. This is sent
to the Superintendent or Factory Manager for approval. If approved
it is then sent to the Pay Clerk, who files the notice for future reference
and makes the required change on his pay-roll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Premium work rates will be made up by the foremen of the
departments, and approved by the Superintendent, in smaller shops.
In large plants the rates will be made up by a clerk in the Production
Department, and approved by the Production Engineer. In either
case they will be sent directly to the Pay Clerk.</p>

<p>Advances to men will be made only in special cases, upon a written
request from the foreman, stating the reasons and approved by the
Superintendent.</p>

<p>The second requirement can be met by having the time cards of
the style used in recording clocks (as shown in Figs. 13,14, and 15).
The convenience and rapidity of making up the time of these cards is
apparent from the fact that the record of the entire week is contained
upon the face of one day time card, lost time being checked only in
red ink in the total column at the right, and the sum of the amounts of
lost time being subtracted from the regular working time for the week
Thus, if the working time is 55 hours per week, and the lost time was
½ hour one day and ¼ hour another, making ¾ hour, we subtract that
from 55, leaving 54¼ hours as the time for the week. This is much
more rapidly done than to carry out the total time for each day and
add up these totals for the six days of the week.</p>

<p>The <i>Pay-Roll Sheet</i> or <i>Pay-Roll Book</i> is shown in Fig. 17. This
is now frequently made as a loose sheet or such number of sheets as
may be necessary to contain all the names, frequently as many as
50 names on the sheet. Upon examination of this printed form, it
will be seen that the regular time is divided into <i>productive</i> and <i>non-productive</i>
labor. This is for the purpose of ascertaining what portion
of the labor is applied directly upon the product, and what portion
is applied indirectly, such as foreman, clerks, general laborers, etc.,
whose work is classed as non-productive.</p>

<p>The amount of the regular time is computed, and entered in the
column headed <i>Amount</i>. If there is an amount due in premiums, it
is entered in the next column, and the two amounts added in the column
headed <i>Total Amount</i>. In the next column is entered the amount of
any advances that may have been made, which is deducted from the
total amount, leaving the net <i>Amount Due</i>, which is entered in the next
column. This amount is paid over to the employee, who signs his
name in the space under <i>By whom received</i>, and the operation is complete.
The men's numbers are placed at the extreme left hand and
right hand of the form as a matter of convenience in rapidly handling
the work of paying off.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>When the pay-roll has been completely made up, it is submitted
to the Superintendent, who certifies as to its being a correct list of
men actually employed, and to the rates of the different men. It is
then submitted to the Factory Manager for approval. After the
amounts due the men are actually paid and receipted for, the Treasurer
certifies the fact, and the pay-roll becomes a voucher for the amount
represented on the roll.</p>

<p><b>Giving Orders for Manufacturing Work.</b> As ordinarily considered,
orders are of two general classes, namely:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">1. <i>Production Orders</i>, by which the production departments are set
to work manufacturing some regular or special product which is to be sold
to customers.</p>

<p class="pbq">2. <i>Plant Orders.</i> These orders relate to the repairs and maintenance
of the grounds, buildings, and equipment of the plant, and to new additions to
and alterations of the same.</p>

<p class="p1">Both of these classes originate with the Factory Manager, who
receives instructions as to all important orders from the General
Manager of the company, who will authorize and keep in touch, not
only with the production of the plant, but in a general way with all
changes, improvements, and maintenance expenses of the establishment.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 18. Production Order.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Production Orders.</b> Fig. 18 shows the form of a regular production
order. This card or blank is made of such dimensions as the
kind of manufacturing business to which it pertains may require. It
is customary to use a card 4 by 6 inches; but if such is to be written
upon the central space in order to describe the work properly, it
should be somewhat larger. The principal features of this form are
spaces for the title of the card, the order number, and date. At the
bottom is given the date when the work is expected to be completed,
and the date of its actual completion. These dates are important as
a matter of reference in considering the promptness and efficiency of
the departments where the work has been done.</p>

<p>The work to be done is briefly described in the central portion,
together with such references to sets of drawings, etc., as may be
necessary to render the terms of the order indisputably certain. This
order is signed by the Factory Manager and sent to the Superintendent.
In a large concern it is sent to the Superintendent of Production or the
Production Engineer, according to the particular manner of the
organization of the official force.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-268.jpg" width="400" height="247"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 19. Sub-Production Order.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In any event the order is turned over to the official having charge
of production, who will make out <i>Sub-Production</i> orders (Fig. 19)
for each department in which the particular work described upon
the orders is to be done. A time limit is given for the completion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the work, and a space provided for the actual date of completion.
They are not signed when issued, but are dated and signed by the
foreman when the work is completed.</p>

<p><b>Plant Orders.</b> As has been described, plant orders are those
necessary for the changes, improvements, and maintenance of the
plant and equipment. In some establishments there are two series
of orders, namely: (<i>a</i>) those for improvements and maintenance of the
<i>plant</i> proper&mdash;that is, grounds and buildings; and (<i>b</i>) improvements
and maintenance of <i>equipment</i>. This is a very proper and natural
division. These accounts may be subdivided to a very great extent,
but not with corresponding value.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-269.jpg" width="400" height="248"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 20. Plant Order.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Plant orders are usually issued by the Superintendent (or General
Superintendent, in a large plant), and are returnable to him, as
will be seen upon reference to the form shown in Fig. 20. This order
is usually directed to a certain department. If more than one department
is involved in the work, a separate order is issued to each. The
general form of the order is the same as in the two preceding ones, the
instructions being changed to suit the nature of the case.</p>

<p>On the back of this order is a form for entering the cost of material
and labor, as shown in Fig. 21. The dates upon which each item
(or group of items) of material is furnished, are given, as are also the
dates for the various items of labor, although the work of an entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
week may be entered upon a single line. On the second half of the
card, space is provided for the totals of both material and labor cost;
also such general expenses in the form of a percentage or such other
apportionment as may be authorized, are entered.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-270.jpg" width="400" height="248"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 21. Back of Plant Order Shown in Fig. 20. For entering cost of material and labor.</p>
</div></div>

<p>By this method the order for the work, and a summary of the
expense of executing the order, are contained upon the same card,
which is very convenient for future reference and comparison.</p>

<p><b>Storing and Issuing Stock and Materials.</b> The orders having
been put in force in the shop, the next step is to obtain the necessary
material or stock with which to do the work.</p>

<p>All purchased stock, material, and stores are turned over to the
General Storekeeper, whose duty it is to classify them, store them
properly, and issue them only on properly authorized requisitions. A
large portion of his stock he obtains by making requisitions upon the
Purchasing Agent.</p>

<p>To account properly for the receipts and issues of this stock so as
always to have on hand what is wanted, and at the same time to avoid
carrying an unnecessarily large stock of any of the articles in store,
he uses a <i>Stock Ledger Card</i> of the form shown in Fig. 22. This
gives the name of the article listed, and its dimensions, weight, etc.
At the right of this are entered the maximum and the minimum
quantities to be kept in stock. Whenever the stock on hand is reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
to near the minimum quantity, the Purchasing Agent is requested
to order enough more to bring the quantity up to the maximum.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-271a.jpg" width="400" height="277"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 22. Stock Ledger Card. Same form is printed also on back of card.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 23. Form of Requisition.<br />
Carbon copies of the entries are made on the Invoice form, Fig. 24.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In making requisitions upon the Purchasing Agent, the Storekeeper
must take into consideration the length of time necessary to
obtain the article wanted. Wire nails, wood screws, and such articles
can usually be obtained in 24 hours, while brass tubing may take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
three weeks. Iron castings can be had in two days, while steel castings
will frequently require six weeks.</p>

<p>When articles are <i>received in stores</i>, the date and quantity will be
entered under the heading <i>Received</i>, and other quantities added to
these as received. Articles issued will be charged under the heading
<i>Issued</i>, giving the date and amount. The quantity on hand may be
quickly ascertained by adding the quantities received and the quantities
issued, and subtracting the sum of the issues from the sum of
the receipts.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-272.jpg" width="400" height="248"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 24. Form of Invoice.<br />
Entries are made by means of carbon paper, duplicating those made on the
Requisition form, Fig. 23.</p>
</div></div>

<p>As most articles are purchased in considerable quantities and
issued in small lots, there will be few entries of receipts and a large
number of entries of issues; therefore the greater portion of the card
is devoted to records of issues. The card is printed with the same
form on both sides; and when the spaces on the first side are filled,
the account is balanced, and the results carried to the opposite side.</p>

<p>These cards are kept in filing drawers, where they are located in
alphabetical order by the names of the articles they represent.</p>

<p>A foreman, on receipt of a regularly numbered and authorized
production order or sub-production order, is thereby authorized to
make requisition for such stock and material as may be necessary to
use in the execution of the order. This he will do by the use of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
<i>Requisition</i> shown in Fig. 23, entering the order number and date, and
specifying the quantities and descriptions of the articles required.
Ordinarily each requisition will contain but one article or class of
articles. At the bottom of the requisition, the foreman will enter the
name of his department and his own signature.</p>

<p>These requisition blanks are made up in pads (the form shown
in Fig. 23), of white paper alternating with tinted paper on which is
the <i>Invoice</i> form shown in Fig. 24. This latter form has its ruling
and other principal features identical with the form of the requisition,
so that by the use of carbon paper the foreman makes a duplicate on
the Invoice blank, of the order number and date, the articles required,
the name of his department, and his own signature.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-273.jpg" width="400" height="252"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 25. Returned Material Card.</p>
</div></div>

<p>When the Storekeeper issues the articles, he first enters upon the
requisition blank the date issued, and then passes it to his assistant,
who notes the issue on the <i>Stock Ledger Card</i>, and then places it on
file. The Storekeeper will enter on the invoice the rate and value of
the articles issued, and the date of issue, and will sign it under the
foreman's signature. He will send it, with the articles issued, to
the foreman, who will in turn make it a part of his report of material
used.</p>

<p>When the work on an order is completed, such serviceable stock
and material as may remain will be returned to the Storekeeper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
together with a <i>Returned Material Card</i> of the form shown in Fig. 25.
The Storekeeper will enter upon it the value of the material returned,
credit it to the department from which it came, and sign the receipt
in the lower left-hand corner. The card will then be returned to the
foreman as his authority for deducting the amount from the material
account in the order in question.</p>

<p><b>Follow-Up Methods for Tracing Orders in the Shop.</b> The Sub-Production
orders having been put into the departments, the first
one will order the material for starting the work. For instance, the
first step may be upon iron castings. Theoretically all stock and
material come from the Store-Room. Therefore we might say that
upon a strict construction of this general rule the castings should be
furnished by the Foundry and sent to the Store-Room, from which
they might be drawn upon requisitions the same as any other material.
Practically this would be not only a troublesome but an expensive
method, requiring a great deal of unnecessary handling and transportation.
The problem is much more practically solved by considering
the Foundry as one of the manufacturing departments receiving its
raw material (namely, pig iron) through storeroom accounts, and thus
"constructively" from the storeroom, while physically it is in the
foundry yard. This answers the demands of a theoretical as well as
a practical view of the case.</p>

<p>Therefore the first sub-production order will go to the iron foundry,
which will make the castings and deliver them to such departments
as are required to do the first work upon them, as directed upon
the order. The sub-production order which this department has
received, directs to what department they shall be sent when completed;
and so on, until they have gone through the last department
and are sent to the Finished Parts Store-Room.</p>

<p>This arrangement is all right as far as it goes. If every man
attended strictly to his business and pushed work along as rapidly as
possible, and every foreman sent his work along to the next department
as soon as his department had completed its work, this plan <i>might</i>
work fairly well. Unfortunately, however, these conditions seldom or
never exist; and there must be ways and means devised to keep the
work moving and to be able to <i>trace</i> and <i>locate</i> the work upon any
order at any time when information is desired upon it or its state of
progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>To accomplish this, there is a <i>Transfer Office</i>, located as conveniently
as may be for all departments, and serving as a sort of
"clearing house" for all departments in transacting inter-departmental
business so far as it relates to the transfer of the work in progress.
By this method, departments send all their work by way of
the Transfer Office, where proper records are kept of all such transfers,
so that at any moment the Transfer Clerk can locate any piece of work
in progress in the plant.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-275.jpg" width="250" height="427"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 26. Transfer Card.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The operation of this method is as follows: The sub-production
orders are sent to the Transfer Clerk, who fills out two <i>Transfer Cards</i>,
as shown in Fig. 26, one of
which he sends with the order
to the first department that is
to do work on the order, and
the other he retains. This
card provides spaces for the
various departments, which
are designated by numbers.
Following these are spaces for
entering the dates of transfers,
the entries being made with a
rubber stamp. After these
spaces are columns for the
number of pieces of work received
and the number of pieces
delivered.</p>

<p>When the first department
has finished its work, the number
of pieces is entered in the
column headed <i>Pieces Delivered</i>,
and the work and the card
sent to the Transfer Office.
The duplicate transfer card
that was retained by the Transfer Clerk was filed in a compartment
in a <i>Transfer Case</i> corresponding to the department where the work
began. He stamps the date of transfer on both cards, entering the
number of pieces on his own, and sends the work on its way to the next
department, together with the transfer card. His own card he removes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
from the compartment representing the first department, and
places it in a compartment representing the department to which he
has now sent the work.</p>

<p>Subsequent transfers are made in the same manner, small lots
of work actually being sent to the Transfer Office, but large lots or
heavy and bulky work being sent directly from one department to the
next, but under the personal direction of the Transfer Clerk or his
assistant.</p>

<p>When the parts are completed and ready for inspection, the
Inspector is notified; and upon inspecting the parts previous to their
being sent to the Finished Parts Store-Room, he enters the results of
his work in the space at the bottom of the card that has accompanied
the work in its progress through the departments.</p>

<div class="floatright">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 27. Transfer Clerk's Card Tray.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Transfer Clerk's <i>card tray</i> is shown in Fig. 27, and is made
with compartments of sufficient dimensions to hold the number of
cards expected to
be on file in any one
department at the
same time. The
cards are filed in
numerical order. In
a large concern the
usual card-index
method of guide
cards is used, so as
to render the work
of finding the right card when wanted, easy and expeditious.</p>

<p><b>Tool-Room Methods.</b> A large number of small tools such as
drills, taps, reamers, and the like, and also numerous jigs and fixtures
of various kinds, are drawn daily from the Tool Room and returned
there after being used. The problem of keeping track of these valuable
tools, of knowing where to locate every tool that has been issued,
and getting them back promptly after they have been used, is an
important one.</p>

<p>The simplest method of doing this is by the use of small brass
checks bearing the individual numbers of the men. For this purpose
a <i>Tool Check Board</i>, as shown in Fig. 28, is provided. This is lined
off in small square or oblong spaces, the number of spaces equaling
or somewhat exceeding the number of men employed in the departments
served by the Tool Room. At the top of each of these spaces
is the name of one of the men; and beneath the name two pins project
about an inch from the face of the board. Under each pin is the
man's individual number. Two forms of brass checks are used, a
circular disc of ⅞ inch diameter, and a rectangular one ½ inch by 1¼
inches. Each check has a hole by which it may be hung on the pins,
and each bears the individual number of the man, the checks being
used in pairs of one circular and one rectangular check.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>All tools are kept upon shelves, divided for individual tools or, in
some similar manner; and in front of each tool is a pin similar to those
on the board, upon which checks may be hung.</p>

<p>The operation of this method is as follows: the circular checks
(there are usually twelve of them) are issued to the men of corresponding
numbers. The rectangular checks are held upon the left-hand
pins under the men's names. When a man goes to the Tool Room for
a tool, or sends a boy for one, he presents one of his circular checks.
This the Tool Keeper hangs on the right-hand pin under the man's
name. He also removes one of the twelve rectangular checks, and
hangs it on the pin in front of the space from which the tool was
taken. If the workman sends for another tool, another circular check
is added to the first one, and another rectangular check removed from
the board.</p>

<p>It will be seen that there must always be twelve checks on the
board under each name, counting both rectangular and circular ones.
The absence of a tool from a shelf is accounted for by the rectangular
check hung on the pin in place of it, and the number of this check
shows what man has the tool. The number of circular checks on the
board shows how many tools each man has in his possession.</p>

<p>The result of this method is that tools can be issued and taken
back very rapidly; and accurate and positive records are very quickly
made, without the use of a book, card, slip, or writing of any kind.</p>

<p>At the end of the week, <i>all</i> tools are turned in to the Tool Room,
thus enabling the Tool Keeper to check them up and rectify any
possible errors that may have been made during the preceding week.
On Monday morning, such tools as are needed are re-issued.</p>

<h2 class="p4">COST-ANALYSIS ENGINEERING</h2>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="p2"><b>Definition.</b> Cost-Analysis Engineering is that branch of Engineering
which has for its object the analysis of costs of construction
or of operation, with a view to effecting a greater economy of production,
and with a view to securing accuracy in estimating the probable
cost of projected structures or operations.</p>

<p><b>The Modern Manager a Cost-Analysis Engineer.</b> It takes few
men to design machines and structures, but it takes many men to
superintend their operation. Therefore the great field of activity for
the engineer of the future is in the field of operation rather than of design.</p>

<p>Until very recent years, engineers have rested satisfied with being
designers of labor-saving appliances. Now, however, they are beginning
to assume the broader and more profitable function of operating
the plants which their brains have created. To handle the ordinary
industrial enterprise successfully, involves:</p>

<p class="pbq p1"><i>First</i>, the application of engineering ability in selecting and improving
the machines used;</p>

<p class="pbq"><i>Second</i>, managerial ability in organizing the workmen, and in stimulating
them to produce a large output economically;</p>

<p class="pbq"><i>Third</i>, advertising ability to sell the product.</p>

<p class="p1">The man who combines in himself the maximum sum of these
three abilities is the man best adapted to succeed as the executive of
an industrial enterprise. Since the introduction of systems of cost
analysis and unit-payments for work done, engineers have become
best qualified to act as managers of manufacturing plants. We include
contracting and railroading among manufacturing industries,
for the contractor manufactures structures, and the railroader manufactures
transportation.</p>

<p>Before cost analysis had been developed to its present stage of
excellence, the successful manager of men was usually one who had
relied upon his lynx eyes and his knowledge of the weaknesses of human
nature. He was often a man who owed his success largely to
the fear he could inspire in his subordinates. He was domineering;
he held his men to their tasks; he was, indeed, an industrial captain;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and he used army discipline. He regarded every worker as a thief
who would not hesitate at petty larceny of time, even in the face of the
foreman, and who delighted in grand larceny behind his back. His
foremen were his spies; and he set himself to spy upon his foremen.
But cost-analysis engineering is evolving a wholly different class of
managers and foremen.</p>

<p>To most people, a cost-keeping system means nothing but a sort
of bookkeeping; and they are unable to understand how a bookkeeper
can develop into a successful manager. But the truth is that modern
cost keeping involves cost analysis, and cost analysis involves a study
and comparison of methods and machines, and such a study leads to
improvements and to commercial success.</p>

<p>Cost keeping, in the sense that we use the term, has for its main
object the determination of the efficiency of men. A proper system
of cost keeping tells you daily what each workman or each gang of
workmen has accomplished. It is better than a foreman, for it cannot
"stand in" with the men. It is better than a foreman, for it costs
you less and it tells you more. A cost-keeping system tells you who
are your good men, and who are your lazy men. It shows you whom
to discharge, and whom to promote. It tells you whose wages are too
high, and whose are not high enough. And, finally, it leads to that
ideal condition of industrial organization known as <i>profit-sharing</i>.
How often have we read in novels of Utopia, where all men share in
the profits of all business; and how often have we smiled with incredulity
at the prospect? Yet Utopia is right here in America, in spots;
and it is a Utopia far more rational than that of the dreamers. There
are many firms that pay their men on a unit-price or bonus system.
This is profit-sharing, and it is a profit-sharing begotten by the use of
cost-keeping systems; for, when a manager has learned by cost keeping
that certain men or groups of men produce more than others, he
soon perceives the advantage of stimulating them to further use of
brain and muscle by paying them either a bonus for each unit produced
in excess of a prescribed minimum, or a unit-price for each
piece of work performed. The men invariably respond to this stimulus,
and often in a remarkable degree. It is nothing unusual for a
man to increase his output 50 per cent upon the introduction of a
bonus system of payment; and there are many instances of increase
amounting to 200 per cent. Each man then becomes a contractor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
and works with the zeal of a contractor, for his earnings increase as
his energy and ability increase. This is practical profit-sharing that
any workman can understand. It is not something vague and intangible,
like 5 per cent per annum. It is something very real and immediate,
for a man can feel it in the pay envelope at the end of every week.</p>

<p>Cost keeping, then, leads to better management, although dispensing
largely with submanagers. It substitutes the record card for
the "big stick," yet the record card itself is the biggest stick ever devised.</p>

<p><b>The Science of Management.</b> The managing of industrial enterprises
is still more or less of an art; but the art is fast passing through
the period of evolution that produces a science. There are, unquestionably,
certain underlying principles of management which can be
summarized into rules or laws. These rules or laws constitute the
science of management, and it is our purpose to present certain of the
more important laws of management.</p>

<p><b>Individual Incentive.</b> When a group of men undertake to do a
certain piece of work, such as shoveling earth into a wagon, the tendency
is for each man to do as little as his neighbor. The inevitable
result is that the shovels move with rhythmic precision, and the slowest
man becomes the pacemaker for the rest. If any one of the men
is ambitious to do a larger day's work, he is deterred by the knowledge
that his employer will never know that it is he to whom the credit
is due for a larger output. Then, too, the other men are apt to upbraid
an ambitious man, and urge him not to set a "bad example" by
working fast. To offset this tendency to fall to the lowest level of
efficiency, employers have placed foremen over their employees, the
duty of these foremen being to accelerate the motions of the men in any
way possible. Each foreman has an <i>individual incentive</i> to get work
done economically, for his employer studies the total amount of work
done by the gang under the foreman, and rewards or punishes the
foreman accordingly, the reward usually consisting of praise and an
increase in salary. But the workmen under such a foreman have
no <i>individual incentive</i>, and they will shirk their tasks as far as possible.
Clearly, then, the first law of management is to create an <i>individual
incentive</i> for every employee to do his best.</p>

<p><b>Creating Individual Incentive in a Gang.</b> There are, and
always will be, certain kinds of work that must be performed by a
group of men working together, or, as we shall call it, a <i>gang</i> of men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
When this is the case, the first step to be taken is to devise a method of
readily and accurately measuring the work performed <i>each day</i>&mdash;not
each week or each month&mdash;by the gang. The next step is to notify
the men that, for all work performed daily in excess of a specified
number of units of work, a bonus or premium will be paid for each
excess unit. Of this bonus, the foreman will get a specified percentage,
and the men will divide the rest among themselves. Thus a powerful
individual incentive is created. It is true that certain men in the
gang will remain less efficient than certain others, but the general
average output will be greatly increased. The foreman himself will
have enough incentive to see to it that the lazy or inefficient workmen
in the gang are discharged, for it will no longer pay him to play the
part of indulgence for the sake of being "a good fellow."</p>

<p><b>Devising Ways of Dispensing with Gang Work.</b> Simply because
it has always been the custom to do certain classes of work by
gangs, should not deter a manager from endeavoring to devise a way
of splitting the gang up into individual units. Indeed, it should be
self-evident that if the creating of individual incentive is the fundamental
law of management, a great amount of study may profitably
be devoted to increasing individual incentive by doing away with gang
work entirely. To illustrate, let us assume that 12 men are engaged
in shoveling earth into wagons, working in two gangs of 6 men, with
one foreman supervising the 12. If a sufficient number of teams and
wagons are used, there will always be 2 wagons in the pit being loaded,
and 6 men shoveling into each wagon. As fast as a wagon is loaded,
it pulls out, and an empty one takes its place. If a manager is told
that he can do away with this system of gang work, he will usually
reply that it is impossible. Nevertheless, it is possible to reduce this
gang work to individual work in most instances, as follows:</p>

<p>Instead of having 2 wagons and teams in the pit all the time, have
6 wagons without teams&mdash;6 empty wagons. Assign two men to each
wagon. Provide a dividing board between the sides of each wagon,
running either longitudinally or cross-wise, so that each man has his
definite half of the wagon to fill. Then pair the men off according to
their respective abilities, putting the two best men on one wagon, the
two next best on another wagon, and so on. When a team brings an
empty wagon into the pit, let it be unhooked from the empty wagon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and hooked to a loaded wagon, thus saving team time, which would
otherwise be consumed in waiting for the wagon to be loaded.</p>

<p>It is possible to give many illustrations of this sort, but not desirable,
for our object is to indicate the laws that should be applied,
rather than to solve specific problems. The student of cost-analysis
engineering will derive his greatest stimulus from applying the laws
to specific cases that come under his own observations.</p>

<p><b>Prompt Reward.</b> Most men believe in Heaven, and many believe
in Hell; but few are greatly affected in their action by the hope of
the one or the fear of the other. Any reward or punishment that is
remote in the time of its application, has a relatively faint influence in
determining the average man's conduct. To be most effective, the
reward or punishment must follow swiftly upon the act. Hence a
managerial policy that may be otherwise good is likely to fail if there
is not a prompt reward for excellence. All profit-sharing systems have
failed, principally because of failure to recognize the necessity of
prompt reward, as well as because of failure to recognize the necessity
of individual incentive. The lower the scale of intelligence, the more
prompt should be the reward. A common laborer should receive at
least a statement of what he has earned every day. If, in the morning,
he receives a card stating that he earned $2.10 the previous day, he
will go at his task with a vim, hoping to do better. But if he does not
know what he has earned until the end of a week, his imagination is
not apt to be vivid enough to spur him to do his best.</p>

<p>One contractor, known to the authors, has a large blackboard on
which the hourly record of his brickmasons is chalked up. He has
found that this constant record of where they stand in the day's race
is a splendid stimulus.</p>

<p><b>Sufficient Reward.</b> When a man produces more than has been
his custom, he feels entitled to a very large percentage of his increased
output. His sense of justice is keen on this matter, and rightly so. It
is true that he is not entitled to all the increase, for his employer may
have provided him with machines or tools of a better kind, for which
payment must ultimately be made. Moreover, more rapid work with
any machine means more rapid wearing-out of its parts, and a consequent
expense to the employer. Finally, the employer who has used
his brains to devise ways of increasing the output of the employees is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>entitled to a very substantial reward. No one begrudges Thomas
Edison his wealth. He has earned it by virtue of his inventions.
In like manner, every man should be richly rewarded for every labor-saving
machine or method which he creates or which he applies.
However, employers are prone to try to take too large a part of the
profit effected by an introduction of a system of unit-payment for work
done.</p>

<p>Mr. Fred W. Taylor says that a workman should receive 30 to 100
per cent increase in wages upon the introduction of a piece-rate or
bonus system of payment. Mr. Halsey says that the workman should
receive one-third of increased value of his product resulting from an
application of the bonus or premium system of payment. But the
fact is that the employer should share liberally with his men; and, in
the long run, the competition of other employers who are bidding for
the services of workmen will force wages up to a point where the workman
secures all but a very moderate percentage of the value of his
daily product.</p>

<p><b>Educational Supervision.</b> As previously stated, the old type of
foreman mingles the functions of a spy with the functions of a mule-driver.
The higher we go in the scale of human intelligence, however,
the more noticeable is the fact that <i>the supervisors are teachers
of the men they supervise</i>. These supervisors, foremen, managers&mdash;call
them what you may&mdash;have learned that it pays better to spend
time in training their men than to spend time in tongue-thrashing.
Only of late years has it been discovered that systematic training of
the least intelligent of workmen pays equally as well as the training of
the most intelligent. The manager who recognizes the necessity of
educational supervision, undertakes, first, a careful time study of each
class of work. Then he analyzes the results, and deduces methods of
securing greater economy. Having evolved a method of procedure,
he reduces it to writing, and furnishes his foremen with detailed
written or printed instructions to be followed, or, where the workmen
are intelligent enough, the instructions are given to them directly;
otherwise it is the function of the foreman to instruct the workmen.</p>

<p><b>Divorce of Planning from Performance.</b> We have just spoken
of the education of the workmen by the manager; but, before such
education is possible, the manager must educate himself. In brief,
he must study the problem and plan its most economic solution.
According to the old-style method of management, each foreman was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
left largely to his own resources in planning methods, and, added to
this duty, he had several other duties to perform, such as "pounding
the men on the back" when lazy, seeing that materials were promptly
supplied, employing and discharging men, looking after the condition
of machines, etc. This multiplicity of duties can be properly performed,
only by a foreman possessed of a multiplicity of talents.
Since few foremen can comply with such a specification for brains, it
follows that good foremen of the old style are rare indeed. The modern
system of management consists in taking away from the foreman
the function of planning the work, and in providing a department that
does all the planning. This planning department should be under
the supervision of the Cost-Analysis Engineer, for it is he and his
assistants who, by unit-timing of work and by cost keeping, are best
able to ascertain what methods should be applied to get the most economic
results. Having planned a method, the Cost-Analysis Engineer
delegates its pursuance to one or more foremen.</p>

<p><b>Subdivision of Duties.</b> The previous rule of action comes under
another, still more general in character&mdash;namely, the law of the <i>subdivision
of duties</i>. Men are gifted with faculties and muscles that are
extremely variable. One man will excel at running a rock drill, another
at keeping time, another at surveying, and so on. It is clear,
therefore, that the fewer the duties that any one man has to perform,
the easier it is to find men who can perform the task well. But give a
man many duties to perform, and he is almost certain to do poorly in
at least one respect, if not in several. One foreman may have a great
knack at "keeping an eye on" machinery, and in having few break-downs
and delays. Then it is the part of wisdom to burden him with
no other duties, unless the magnitude of the work does not warrant
dividing the duties among two or more men. Let him be the <i>machinery
and tool foreman</i>, reporting directly to the Cost-Analysis Engineer,
and subordinate to no other foreman.</p>

<p>Another foreman may have a special knack at teaching workmen
how to use tools and machines. Let him have no other duty but to see
that the men have the proper tools, get them promptly, and use them
properly. Let him be the <i>gang foreman</i>.</p>

<p>According to the magnitude of the work, there may be different
kinds of foremen, all coming in contact with the same men, perhaps,
but each performing different functions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Limitations of Military Organization.</b> Most industrial organizations
to-day resemble military organizations, with their generals and
intermediate officers, down to sergeants, each man reporting to but
one man higher in rank. There is little doubt that the present tendency
in industrial organizations is to abandon the military system
to a very large extent, and for the following reasons:</p>

<p>A soldier has certain duties to perform, few in number, and simple
in kind. Hence the man directly in command can control the actions
of his subordinates easily and effectively. Control, moreover, should
come invariably from the same officer, to avoid any possibility of disastrous
confusion, and <i>to insure the instant action of a body of men as
one single mass</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, industrial operations do not possess the same
simplicity, particularly where men are using machines; nor is there the
necessity of action in mass. The military organization, therefore,
should be modified to suit the conditions; and one of these modifications
is the introduction of two or more foremen in charge of certain
functions or duties of the same men or groups of men, as explained in
the paragraph on <i>Subdivision of Duties</i>.</p>

<p><b>Opposition to Change.</b> All men have a certain mental inertia
which makes them resist any change of their methods and habits.
Foremen are particularly resistant to change, because of their custom
of giving orders more frequently than receiving orders. Hence the
Cost-Analysis Engineer who is trying to introduce modern methods is
sure to meet with violent opposition from foremen; and the older the
foreman, the more violent the opposition. When the Cost-Analysis
Engineer introduces a new method, he must personally attend to every
detail, or it will surely "go wrong." The old foreman will see to it
that it does "go wrong," just to show that the "new-fangled ideas" are
worthless.</p>

<p>Opposition may also develop among labor unions, particularly
if it is proposed to pay on the piece-rate plan&mdash;that is, to pay so and so
much for each unit of work performed. The bonus plan and the premium
plan (to be described later) are schemes to overcome this opposition
to the piece-rate plan, but in essence they are all the same.</p>

<p>No manager of men can attain great success unless he has grit
enough and tact enough to overcome the opposition to change which
he will encounter from all quarters. If he realizes in advance that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
such opposition is as certain to manifest itself as it is certain that it
takes power to change the direction or speed of motion of a heavy body,
he will have possessed himself of one of the laws of successful management.</p>

<p>A man cannot impart motion to a very heavy rock by violent
impact of his own body against it; but he can separate it into fragments,
and move each fragment by itself. In like manner, no attempt
should be made to change all the methods of an industrial organization
at one stroke. Separate it into elements, and take one element at
a time, beginning with the simplest. Apply your cost-keeping system
to that element&mdash;it may be only the hauling of materials with
teams&mdash;and effect the change desired. Then take another element of
the organization, and apply the system to it. Continue thus, fragment
by fragment, and you will overcome the opposition that
would otherwise resist your greatest effort.</p>

<p><b>Respect Your Own Ability.</b> One of the most common mistakes
made by managers lies in assuming that a skilled workman necessarily
knows better how to perform work than does the manager himself. A
manager should first aim to familiarize himself with the methods used
by the best workmen, and then, by an itemized time study, he should
set his own wits to work to improve the methods. Workmen, for the
most part, do their work just as robins build their nests&mdash;by the pattern
of precedent. They put little or no brains into improving the process,
because it usually means no money in their pockets to effect an
improvement, and because they reason that an improvement that
effects a saving in time may actually result in the discharge of some of
their fellow workmen. It should be a cardinal law of management to
give very little weight to the claims that workmen make as to their
own skill or knowledge; and the same holds true as to foremen. Because
a man has blasted rock for twenty years, should not make his
opinion of such force as to prevent a manager from undertaking to
show that man how to do rock-blasting more economically. We have
frequently effected great economies in rock-blasting after a time study
occupying fewer weeks than the blaster had occupied of years in the
same sort of work. The trained mind of the Cost-Analysis Engineer
enables him to analyze costs and methods, and to develop improvements
which no amount of so-called "practical experience" can effect.</p>

<p>Weigh carefully every <i>reason</i> against any proposed change in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
method, and act accordingly; but pay no attention whatsoever to predictions
of failure that are bare of reasons. Do not be influenced even
by many positive statements that your proposed method has been tried
and has failed; for its failure may have been purposely brought about,
or some small condition essential to its success may have been absent.</p>

<p>Therefore, respect your own ability. The manager who cannot
improve upon methods used by his men is not fit to manage.</p>

<p><b>Profit Does Not Mean Excellence.</b> Many a manager points to the
profits of his business as the profit of his ability. He forgets that to a
plainsman a small hill looks like a mountain. The general level of
mediocrity makes such managers fancy that they are quite extraordinary
if their business shows a large profit.</p>

<p>The Cost-Analysis Engineer can frequently take a profitable
business and convert it into a wealth-producer beyond all dreams of
the ordinary self-satisfied manager. Nor should the Cost-Analysis
Engineer himself grow satisfied. <i>There is positively no limit to the
economies in production which may be effected by the human brain.</i></p>

<p><b>The Human Engine.</b> The human body is an engine, or rather a
boiler and engine combined. Its fuel is about 3 pounds of solid food
daily, containing about as much energy as one pound of carbon or
coal. One pound of coal will develop energy enough to perform about
10,000,000 foot-pounds of work; that is, it will raise 10,000,000 pounds
one foot high, if there is no loss of power. But in all boilers and engines
there is a loss of power, due to heat lost by radiation, heat carried away
in the escaping gases and solids, etc., and heat developed by friction.
A steam boiler and engine suffers so much loss of heat energy from
these sources, that it rarely develops an efficiency of more than 10 per
cent of the theoretical energy of the coal consumed. Curiously
enough, the human body is not much more efficient than a steam
boiler and engine; so that, while the one pound of carbon fed into the
human body has a theoretical energy of about 10,000,000 foot-pounds,
the actual useful work performed by a man is seldom more than
1,500,000 foot-pounds a day, or about 15 per cent of the theoretical
energy of the food consumed.</p>

<p>When a man is walking, his whole body rises and falls each step,
the rise being about one-seventh of a foot. Hence, in walking 25 miles
in a day, about 2,000 steps per mile, a man weighing 140 pounds does
1,000,000 foot-pounds of work in raising the weight of his own body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
to say nothing of the energy consumed in swinging his legs. A man
may walk the 25 miles in 10 hours, or he may walk it in 8 hours. In
either case, he does substantially the same amount of work, and burns
up substantially the same amount of food.</p>

<p>It should be clear, therefore, that when workmen are doing intermittent
work, with periods of comparative rest, they are capable of
working correspondingly harder during the periods of exertion. Thus,
in running a rock drill, the physical labor is light, except when shifting
the drill or when changing drill bits. At such times, the men should
be required to work with great vigor in order to reduce the lost time.</p>

<p>It should also be clear that workmen should be taught to make no
unnecessary movements of the body in doing work. Yet it is a fact
that few workmen economize their energy by avoiding unnecessary
motions.</p>

<p>It should also be clear that it pays to house workmen at no great
distance from their work, so as to reduce the labor of going to and
from the work; for every foot-pound of energy spent in going or coming
reduces by that much the available energy of the man.</p>

<p>If it were practicable to measure the amount of resistance involved
in doing each class of physical work, we could readily reduce
to a science the setting of reasonable daily tasks. The authors are of
the opinion that a careful study of <i>resistances</i> will eventually enable
managers to fix certain tasks with great accuracy. To illustrate, let
us assume that it is desired to know how much sand a workman should
be able to shovel into a wagon box 5 feet from the ground in a day.
It is not impracticable to measure the force required to push the shovel
into the sand, and the distance pushed. The average weight of the
earth on a shovel, and the weight of the shovel can be ascertained.
The vertical height that this load is lifted, is easily measured. If the
workman bends his body to fill the shovel, the weight of his body above
the waist, multiplied by the height that the center of gravity of that
weight travels will give the foot-pounds of work done in bending the
body. And thus, by a calculation of each element of work done, an
accurate forecast of the total possible work could be made.</p>

<p>Such a study as this will often disclose an unsuspected lack of
economy in using certain tools. From such a study, for example, it is
perfectly clear that the long-handled shovel, universally used in the
far West for shoveling sand, gravel, etc., is a more economical tool than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the short-handled shovel used in the East. Men have argued about
this matter for years without coming to a definite conclusion, the
reason being that workmen accustomed to the short-handled shovel
prefer it, while workmen accustomed to the long-handled shovel show
an equal preference for that type of tool.</p>

<h3 class="p2">COST GETTING</h3>

<p>In taking of time and in the application of the cost of labor to
the cost of work, there are probably as many systems as there are organizations
doing work; and even within any one organization using a
well-defined system throughout its entire operations, there will be no
two men making the same interpretation of the rules laid down, or&mdash;more
especially&mdash;whose methods of attack will be the same. But
in spite of these many variations of method, there are several primary
systems which are standard, and which can be found in one form
or another on all properly conducted work.</p>

<p>The starting point of all cost getting is the taking of the time in
the field, and it is here that the greatest variation in individual method
is found. The most common way of taking this time record from
which the pay-roll and the cost distribution is made, is for the time-keeper
to go over the work with a notebook and put down therein with
a pencil the number of each man and the particular part of the work
that he is engaged on.</p>

<p>Two systems of record keeping, of which small cards form the
basis, are also in vogue. One of these systems uses what is known as
<i>punch-cards</i>&mdash;that is, cards in which the records of time, distribution,
and performance are made by means of an ordinary conductor's
punch; and the other has the record made in a way somewhat similar
to the entries in a notebook&mdash;a written record being made on the cards
with a pencil. Another system bases its records upon reports turned
in by foremen.</p>

<p><b>Time-Keeper with Notebook.</b> While the manner of taking time
with a notebook varies according to the training and experience of the
time-keeper, it may be said that there are in general two ways in which
such notes are kept. In the first, the time-keeper has a list of the numbers
of all men on the work, and, as he goes over the work, simply
checks off the numbers, showing that each particular man is at work
and indicating upon what branch of the work he is engaged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>A more common way, however, is for the time-keeper to make
headings corresponding to the distribution used in making up the
office records, and to write under each of these headings the numbers
of the men working upon the part of the work so named. This
method is often simplified by the time-keeper becoming so familiar
with the foreman, and the numbers of the men under the particular
foreman, that he is able to dispense with the headings entirely, and
simply use the foreman's name or number in place of it. This, of
course, makes the time-keeper's notes more or less unintelligible to
anyone but himself, and makes it necessary for him to do office work
as well as his field work. Moreover, not being a permanent or intelligible
record, it is impossible for even the man who made the notes to
return to them in case any dispute arises or a mistake is found to have
been made, and get information after the notes have "grown cold."
The time-keeper becomes so familiar with the appearance of the men
who are on the work, that he learns to know their numbers, and often
attempts to put them down without seeing their numbered checks.
This is often a source of error, as the uneducated foreign laborer is very
liable to make a mistake in stating his number; and if he does, there
will exist no record of his having worked that day, and he will get no
pay for it. The apportioning of the cost of his labor to any work that
he may have been on, will also be the cause of trouble.</p>

<p>Of course, the time-keeper's memory serves him if any men are
absent from the gang for any reason, and he is able to ask the foreman
whether or not that particular man is working. A man may be away
from the gang and be missed by the time-keeper altogether. In this
case, no chance is given for correction of the record, unless the time-keeper
goes over the work again soon after; and the consequence is
that costs will be in error, and the men will be short of pay at the end
of the month. This is especially liable to be true when night work
is being done.</p>

<p>Men may be changed from gang to gang, or a whole gang may be
changed from one job to another, and the time-keeper knows nothing
of it unless he happens to be on the spot at just the right time. Such
a change would not show in his time record; and while the men would
get credit for their full time, the distribution of costs would be much
in error. The difficulty in recording such changes can be seen from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the following extract from a report of a Consulting Engineer after
inspecting work upon a road-making contract:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">"In one case, at 10:30, there were eight men carrying stone to the crusher,
and three men on the crusher platform. Two others were in the cut, loosening
earth and loading; and half an hour later, two of the four men who had been
blasting were also loosening and loading."</p>

Duplicate record is made<br />automatically on a similar slip<br />by
carbon paper.</p>
</div></div>

<p>This, of course, indicates an unusually loose organization, but is an
example of what a
time-keeper with a
notebook has to contend
against.</p>

<p>In case of emergency&mdash;say
in steam
shovel work&mdash;a
train of dump cars
goes over the side of
a dump, and a track
gang is called upon
to help the regular
dump gang so that
the difficulty may be
overcome as soon as
possible. The time-keeper
might fail to
make record of an
hour or an hour and
a-half which the
track gang put on
this work, because
he did not see them
at work at that particular
time. This,
of course, affects the
distribution of cost. One advantage from the notebook is that much
of the distribution is made in the field, with a corresponding reduction
of office work.</p>

<p><b>Punch-Cards.</b> The keeping of time by means of punch-cards has
been tried with considerable success on many jobs, but only recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
has it been reduced to a practical basis for use on large construction
work.</p>

<p>The Construction Service Company of New York City has developed
a system of time and cost keeping, using the duplicate punch-card
almost entirely. Several of these cards are reproduced in connection
with this text.</p>

<p>As a general thing, the punching of the cards is done by foremen
of the gang, or by someone who has the performance of the gang under
direct observation. The cards show not only the time worked by
each man upon any one day, but just as exactly the time worked upon
any job by all the men. A duplicate of the record is made automatically,
to be kept in the time-keeper's office, the other going to headquarters
for permanent record.</p>

<p>The record thus obtained is absolutely exact, especially as to distribution;
but the system has some of the same objections that the notebook
has. For instance, unless the cards are kept by the foreman himself,
whoever punches them may inadvertently miss a man. This,
however, is not so liable to happen as when a notebook is used. Whenever
a single punch appears opposite a man's number, it is apparent
that all his time must be accounted for in some way or other; while,
with a notebook, it may be that, having been missed once, no record
of any time will appear.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no opportunity for a time-keeper or for a
foreman to "fudge" his account in any way, for a punch mark once
made in the card cannot be erased or destroyed in any way. The
record stands.</p>

<p><b>Time-Keeper's Cards.</b> Instead of the time-keeper keeping his
records in a notebook, as has been described, he may be provided with
slips of tough paper of such size and shape as will readily go into his
pocket, or will fit in a filing cabinet.</p>

<p>The <i>modus operandi</i> of these cards or slips is as follows:</p>

<p>Each card or slip is devoted to but one gang and one ledger account&mdash;such,
for example, as placing ties in railroad work, gang No. 6.
It will show the foreman's name; the name or number, or both, of
each man; and the amount of time that he spent on this particular
class of work. The sum of the amounts for the gang on this classification,
will be the cost for this gang and this account for the day in
question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>If a man has been working at more than one piece of work on that
day, the time-keeper makes the apportionment of time on the spot;
and the portion of his time that he has spent placing ties is put on the
"Placing Ties" card or slip. The remainder of his time is placed on
another slip corresponding to the other ledger account. If the time-keeper
is uncertain as to which ledger account the work belongs to,
he writes a description of the work at the top of the card or slip. A
convenient form for a slip is illustrated in Fig. 1; and a convenient form
for a file card, in Fig. 2.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 2. Time-Keeper's Card.<br />
Duplicate record is made automatically on similar card by carbon paper.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is frequently of advantage to have time-cards show, in addition
to their pay and work performed, a log of the conditions, such as temperature
and weather; the causes and duration of each delay; the general
conditions on the work; the kind, condition, and the make of tools,
machinery, etc.; and any further details that may be important. How
this can be done on the various cards illustrated in this volume, can be
seen from a study of the illustrations.</p>

<p><b>Written Time-Cards</b> have the advantage of the minimum of departure
from existing methods; the disadvantages that arise are slight;
and it is difficult to so arrange the cards as to obtain duplicates. A
foreman with a dirty thumb will make a paper sheet on which he writes
in the field look as if it had been dragged through the mud; while, with
a punch, he can bring his card in with comparatively small damage.
In general, it may be said that for the time-keeper's use the written
card has a slight advantage over the punch-card; while the reverse is
the case for records to be obtained by the foreman, or whenever the
men, such as drillers or teamsters, hold their own cards.</p>

<p><b>Foreman's Report.</b> When the making-up of the pay-roll and the
distribution of cost depend upon the reports of foremen, many serious
difficulties are introduced into the work. Most foremen are intelligent
enough to make a satisfactory report, and even more of them are
honest enough to make a correct report. It is a curious fact, however,
that among men of this class, while they would use every care in
accounting for money entrusted to them, there is no tendency to consider
time in the same light; and in consequence the reports of time
given are liable to be very lax.</p>

<p>Moreover, if a foreman felt so inclined, if there were no one checking
him or his reports, it would be a very simple matter for him to
"fudge" his accounts so as to be able to acquire considerable graft.</p>

<p>If the foreman is intelligent and conscientious, a report and a
distribution can be obtained from him which would be very easy to
work into an excellent office record. Unfortunately, the desired combination
seldom obtains, and there are very few large works carried
on with such a system of time-keeping.</p>

<p><b>Cost Distribution.</b> The time having been taken in the field, it
now becomes necessary to make a distribution of costs in the office.
The cost is that which is paid for producing work, being the material
and labor cost of production, added to the proper proportions of expense
cost, the expense being incurred in carrying on the operation
and so making the actual work a possibility. The distribution of the
cost is necessary in order that the contractor may see whether or not
any particular operation is profitable; and a detailed analysis of the
distribution, such as will be given later, will indicate in what respect
the work may be made cheaper and more profitable.</p>

<p>In all cost distribution, there are certain items which cause
trouble; and their proper disposition has led to much discussion among
authorities on them, and has been the source of many different arrangements
for their proper apportioning to the various operations
on the work. For instance, there is the time of such men as are engaged
upon water-supply service, drainage systems, the blacksmith,
machinists, electricians, water boy, the time of watchmen, police, etc.,
which may come under the heading of "general labor;" and there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
such items as the transportation and distribution of coal to various
parts of the work, the transportation and handling of stores, and numerous
other items which, while seemingly affecting the whole work,
are directly chargeable to some particular operation.</p>

<p>In many instances of distribution, the item of <i>General Expenses</i>,
which includes the expense of storekeeper, time-keeper, bookkeepers,
clerks, and such office force as may be required, is rather difficult of
disposition. Those items which are usually monthly, may be distributed
daily at a rate per day found by dividing the monthly rate by the
number of days in the month, or they may be lumped at the end of the
month and apportioned to the various operations. If they are distributed
from day to day, it is rather difficult to tell just what proportion
of them should go to each operation, as the cost of any operation
is liable to vary greatly from day to day. If they are left to the end of
the month, it is impossible to tell from day to day the exact cost of the
work.</p>

<p><i>Overhead Expenses</i> are another source of difficulty. Under this
heading can be placed all salaries which do not ordinarily appear upon
the pay-roll, such as the salary of the General Manager of the work, the
Chief Engineer, and the officers of the company, and such expenses as
office rent, telephone, office furniture, stationery, etc. Just where
General Expenses leave off, and Overhead Expenses begin, is rather
hard to determine, the line of demarcation varying in almost all cases.</p>

<p>One of the greatest troubles in distribution is caused by overtime
of men who are on a daily and monthly basis. Under the same
head might be placed <i>Lost Foreman's Time</i>&mdash;that is, the time which
the monthly and daily men are paid for, and which produces no output.</p>

<h3 class="p2">TIME-KEEPER'S NOTEBOOK</h3>

<p>A page from a time-keeper's notebook is reproduced in Fig. 3.
The necessity for an explanation of such a record is apparent. The
work on which this record was made, was a job of rock excavation on
which two steam shovels were being used, and the time and output of
each shovel were kept separately. The record was made on the 17th
of the month.</p>

<p>At the left of the page, within the curved line under the heading
"<i>sh. 2</i>," we have the names of the shovel crew and the numbers of the
pit men. At the side of these names and numbers, is the record of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
performance of the shovel of the day previous, the 16th, the shovel
runner having given it to the time-keeper while the latter was on his
first round on the 17th. Just below the record of the shovel, there are
four numbers under a heading <i>Ditch</i>. In order to drain the shovel pit,
it was necessary to use four men for cutting a ditch, and the time of
these men is charged
to the shovel. Underneath
the record
for the No. 2 shovel,
is the record of
shovel No. 1. It is
recorded in exactly
the same way as the
other record.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-300.jpg" width="250" height="425"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">Fig. 3. Page from a<br />Time-Keeper's Notebook.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the center of
the page, at the top,
is the record of the
drill gang for each
shovel. There were
six drills working in
gang No. 2; but the
record does not
show this clearly, as
there are two
columns of six numbers
each, one
column being the
driller's numbers,
and the other being
those of the drill
helpers. Then there
is a column of four
numbers representing
the muckers.
The time-keeper knows, of course, which is which; but if for any reason
anyone else than himself had to use the notes in the office, they would
be useless. The number under the line is that of the man who
carries bits to and from the blacksmith. The name of the fireman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
of the boiler which furnishes steam to the drills is given, and the
number of his helper.</p>

<p>The record of gang No. 1 is given in the same garbled manner,
there being 5 drillers, 5 helpers, and 4 muckers in the gang, besides
the man carrying bits, the fireman (whose name is given), and his
helper. It will be noticed that in neither gang is the name or number
of the foreman given, the time-keeper relying upon his memory
to make the record complete in the office.</p>

<p>In the upper right-hand corner of the page, is the record of the
blasting gang, in front of shovel No. 1. There are 5 men, including the
foreman, whose number is given first. Within the ring is shown
the number of pounds of powder used on the previous day as reported
by the foreman. The record reads "on the 16th, 150 pounds of 30%
powder, and 750 pounds of 40%."</p>

<p>Directly below this, midway down the page, is the record of the
men working on dump No. 1. The foreman's number heads the list,
the numbers of his men following.</p>

<p>Just to the right of the shovel records, and below the record for
drill gang No. 2, is the heading "<i>ng.tr. # 1</i>;" and the men whose
numbers are under this heading are engaged in laying and repairing
the narrow-gauge track for the dump trains from shovel No. 1. Just
below the middle of the page, is a list of names and numbers utterly
unintelligible to anyone but the one who made it. The facts are
these: <i>Donovan</i> is the man who looked after the storage of powder;
within the bracket, <i>Nick</i> (the time-keeper, not knowing the
last name, used his number, as well as the part of the name that he
knows) is the blacksmith; and No. 72 is his helper; No. 118 helped
the blacksmith for two hours, having been taken from the narrow-gauge
track gang. The time-keeper had to depend entirely upon the
blacksmith telling him this, or his record would have been incomplete.
The next three men whose names appear in this column were
engaged upon repairing a 6-inch pipe line; and the next two pairs
within brackets, marked No. 2 and No. 1, are the pipe-fitters for
the drill gangs and shovels No. 2 and No. 1 respectively.</p>

<h3 class="p2">DISTRIBUTION FROM TIME-KEEPER'S NOTEBOOK</h3>

<p>The time-keeper, having taken his notes over the entire job, sends
them to the office so that the time may be posted for each man, and
the distribution made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>The time-keeper goes over his notes, and picks out the items that
are chargeable to drilling. In gang No. 2, there are 6 drillers at 30 cents
per hour; 6 helpers, 4 muckers, 1 man carrying bits, and one fireman's
helper, all at 17 cents, and one fireman at 25 cents. From the note at
the bottom of the page, he knows (although no one else would) that
<i>Lear</i> at 20 cents and No. 278 at 17 cents, were also with this gang.
This, with the foreman at $3.50 per day, figures to $29.08. These
are the charges that go directly to drilling, being the cost of time of
the men actually engaged upon that operation and nothing else. But
besides this, there must be apportioned to this cost a certain part of the
Superintendent's salary, a portion of the labor on the 6-inch water
pipe and the whole water system, a portion of the time of the blacksmith,
the watchman, the storekeeper, the time-keeper, clerks, the
water boy, and numerous other items.</p>

<p>In exactly the same way, the cost of the operation of the steam
shovels is figured. For instance, No. 2 has an engineer at $125, a
cranesman at $100, and a fireman at $75, a month, and 6 pitmen at
20 cents per hour, making the total charge of crew $19.27. To this
the time-keeper added $5.44 as the cost of digging the ditch that
drains the shovel pit. To charge this whole amount against the
shovel for that day, is manifestly unjust, as the work of draining
through this ditch will continue for many days, always facilitating
the work of the shovel. The cost of subsequent days' work is lessened,
while the cost of this particular day, as given with the $5.44
charge against it, is entirely too high. The spreading of an item of
this kind is an extremely difficult matter, but it must be done. The
steam-shovel cost must also have its proportional share of the charge
for Superintendent, water system, blacksmith, etc.</p>

<p>The charge for narrow-gauge track is $14.86, being the time of
one foreman at 20 cents, and 9 men for 8 hours and one man for 6 hours
at 17 cents. The charge against No. 1 dump is $8.40, being the time
for one foreman at 20 cents, and 5 men for 8 hours at 17 cents. The
cost of blasting is figured exactly the same way, and the 900 pounds of
powder used entered in the material account charged against the work
in front of shovel No. 1.</p>

<p>The headings for the distribution of steam-shovel work, aside
from <i>Drilling</i> and <i>Blasting</i>, would be <i>Shovel crew</i>, <i>Pit crew</i>, <i>Dump crew</i>,
<i>Laying shovel track</i>, <i>Train crew</i>, and <i>Laying narrow-gauge track</i>, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of which in the end can be summarized under <i>Loading and Transporting</i>,
and the unit-cost of moving a yard of material figured from
this summary.</p>

<h3 class="p2">PUNCH-CARDS</h3>

<p>The manner in which the time-keeper takes his notes in a notebook
has been shown, and the impracticability of many of its phases
pointed out. Two punch-cards for use on such work as that mentioned&mdash;namely,
rock excavation with steam shovels and dump trains&mdash;are
shown in Figs. 4 and 5. They are the <i>Steam-Shovel Card</i> and the
<i>Train Record</i>. The shovel card is kept by the shovel runner or the fireman,
and the train record is kept by the dinkey runner. Each keeps
his own record separately; and, at the end of the day's work, the
records must check each other.</p>

<p>The steam-shovel card shows the date, the number of cars loaded
per hour, and the total number loaded per day. It also shows the time
of starting and stopping the shovel for any reason, the stops for moving
up being indicated in a different way from other stops; and thus a
record of moves is kept automatically. The time of the shovel crew
and the exact number of hours worked by the pit crew, are also shown,
together with the cubic feet of coal consumed by the shovel. The
causes of delays and the condition of the shovel are written in the
blank spaces under their proper heading at the bottom of the card;
but with this exception, the entire record is made with the use of an
ordinary conductor's punch.</p>

<p>The train card shows the number of trips made by a train each
day, the time of leaving the shovel on any trip being shown to the nearest
5 minutes. The number of cars hauled by all the trains during any
hour must check with the number of cars loaded, as shown on the
shovel card. The train card, besides showing the date, shows the total
number of cars hauled (the total of all cards must check the total cars
as shown by the steam-shovel record), the cubic feet of coal consumed,
the average yardage per car, the haul in stations of 100 feet, the number
of the dinkey engine, and a report of its condition, whether it be good,
fair, or bad. This card is signed with the dinkey runner's name.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the record is very much more complete than
that taken by the time-keeper, and is more reliable as to methods, being
made while the work is going on; and the greater part of it is checked
by having two records made separately, instead of taking a verbal
report from the shovel runner the following day as in the example previously
shown.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither the train record nor shovel card, however, show any distribution
of time, but are really performance records. The pipe and
steamfitter's card reproduced in Fig. 6 gives an excellent example of
how the time is taken and the distribution automatically made all at
one time.</p>

<p>The classifications of labor are: Shovel, Channeller, Drills, Dinkey,
and Trains, Pump, Tank, General Water System, and Blacksmith,
being lettered, it will be noticed, from <i>A</i> to <i>H</i> at the head of the column.
Each card provides space for the record of the foreman and 14
men. These eight classifications will probably cover all the work
that the pipe and steamfitters are called upon to do; but if not, there
are two extra lines on which can be written any classifications out of
the ordinary.</p>

<p>There will be certain men assigned to certain regular work, as in
the case previously quoted under the head of the Time-Keeper's Notebook,
where there were two pipemen for each drill outfit. If these men
spend their entire day of eight hours doing nothing but looking after
the water supply for the drills, a punch mark would be made above the
number of each of them on the card and opposite the figure 8, which
represents the hours worked. To the left of the eight, and in the same
line, and also in the vertical column opposite the word <i>Drills</i>, another
punch mark will be made. Again, opposite the letter <i>C</i>, which is the
key for the classification of drills, and in the column assigned to each
man, and below his name, another punch mark will be made. This
gives the workman full time, showing that he worked eight hours on
drill water supply and nothing else. Suppose the foreman worked
three hours on the general water system, three hours on the pumping
station, and two hours directing the repair of the water tank. There
would then be on the record a punch mark in his column opposite 3, 6,
and 8; at the left of 3 in the column headed <i>G</i>, another punch will
appear; at the left of 6 in the column <i>E</i>, another punch will be found,
and still another at the left of 8 in the column <i>F</i>. In the column under
the foreman's name, punch marks would be made opposite <i>E</i>, <i>F</i>, and
<i>G</i>, showing that he worked on these three classifications.</p>

<p>In the same way, the time and occupation of each man under this
foreman can be indicated, no matter how many changes he may make
in his work during the day. The time, however, is recorded only to
the nearest hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Provision is made in the lower left-hand corner, for the punching
of the date; and along the lower edge is the place for the recording of
the number of hours used in thawing the pipes, etc., and in providing
protection for them. This latter record was found necessary, because
the work on which these cards were used was done in an extremely
cold locality and continued throughout the entire year.</p>

<p>When the records are made in the field and are sent in to the
office to be transferred to permanent records, it is not necessary for
the man who made the record to be at hand to interpret his notes, as
there is absolutely no opportunity given him to allow his note taking
to vary in the least from day to day, the record being absolutely automatic.</p>

<h3 class="p2">PROCESS COST SUBDIVISION</h3>

<p>While the object of the regular distribution of cost is the obtaining
of unit-costs, there is another cost analysis which may be called a
refinement of the cost-keeping system, and which, if properly used,
can bring about a marked reduction in all costs. While this will be
discussed more fully in the chapter upon <i>Reduction of Cost</i>, it is a form
of time-keeping, and so will be touched upon here. On more or less
rough construction work, it seems rather absurd to attempt to reduce
the various processes of any operation to such a fineness that they
may be timed to minutes and even to seconds. Conditions vary so
greatly, the character of the work being done changes so much from
time to time, and the personnel of the organization is sometimes
shifted so much, that it seems impossible to reduce performance to any
satisfactory basis which may be used as a standard. Nevertheless,
without attempting to reach such a basis, careful watching and timing
of the different parts of the work will result in much better performance
and increased profits, as can be clearly shown.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, a driller working with a steam drill in fairly
even rock, with no marked obstacles in his way and with very little
mucking to do. Notice the exact time at which his tripod is in place
and the drill ready to work. The driller places his bit in the drill,
turns on the steam, and the drill starts. Note the time of starting the
drill; note the time when the drill stops, the bit having gone down its
full length; and do the same with each subsequent bit, noting carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the exact time consumed in changing. When the last bit is
down its full length and the hole is finished, note the time required to
take out the bit, move the weights, loosen the tripod, and make everything
ready for the moving. Then note just how many men are
required to move the drill, and just how long it takes them to do it;
and finally, how long it takes the driller to get his drill again in working
order and started.</p>

<p>It will be found that a large majority of drillers take entirely too
much time in the changing of bits, and that almost invariably there
are too many men helping to move a drill, and that they take too long
for it. Another source of delay is preparing the drill for work after it
has been moved. It is perhaps just as well to take plenty of time for
this, in order to get the drill properly set and adjusted before starting
it; but the loss of time between the adjustment and the starting may be
said to be about the same as that lost in changing bits, if not a little
more.</p>

<p>When the driller takes too long in changing bits, it is largely his
own fault, and he should be watched more carefully by the foreman,
and, if necessary, instructed. If time is wasted in the moving of the
drill, it is the fault of the foreman alone. By a careful timing and
balancing of the various processes in drilling, the most competent men
can easily be picked out.</p>

<p>In the case of concreting, the minutes lost in the handling of a
batch of material from the stock pile to its final position as concrete,
often amount to a great deal. Suppose on a small job a half-yard
mixer is being used, and it averages for 8 hours 30 batches per hour,
or 120 yards per day. If it is possible to reduce the time of each
batch 15 seconds, the output of the plant will be increased over 14
per cent; or, figured on a basis of 120 yards, there will be an increase
of 17 yards, which&mdash;at, say, $5.00 per yard&mdash;would mean a handsome
increase in the daily profits. And still, 15 seconds seems to be almost
too trivial a matter for which to spend time and perhaps a little
extra money in the way of time-keeping.</p>

<p>Starting with the unmixed material in the stock pile, notice how
long it takes the men to load their wheelbarrows with sand and stone;
then the time that the material remains in the wheelbarrow, both at
the beginning and stopping end of the trip to the mixer; and also the
time in transit. If the material is dumped into measuring boxes, note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the time that it remains in the boxes. If it is dumped directly from
the wheelbarrows into the mixer, it is necessary to take the time of
mixing from when the first wheelbarrow was dumped until the batch
is dumped. The mixer may be said to be the governor of the whole
operation; for the men handling unmixed material can handle it no
faster than the mixer takes it, and the men handling the mixed concrete
can get it no faster than the mixer furnishes it to them. For
this reason the observation of the operation of the mixer should be
made with special care. It is not our intention to tell how, or to give
advice concerning the mixing of concrete; but it is desired to show
how, if any time is to be saved, it will be through the saving of seconds
in each operation.</p>

<p>If the mixed concrete is to be dumped as a batch into the hopper
or hoist, the question of time saving is much simpler than if portions
of the batch have to be dumped into wheelbarrows. If, however, it
is necessary to dump into wheelbarrows, a basis for the time necessary
to empty the mixer can be found only by careful timing and noting
the action of the men during the timing.</p>

<p>The time between the filling and the emptying of the wheelbarrow
of concrete, will of course vary greatly according to the haul; but here
again, careful timing and observation will soon establish a basis from
which the most economical manner of distributing the concrete can
be made; and exactly the same thing is true of the return of the empty
barrels.</p>

<p>All of this may seem to be a digression from the subject of cost
getting; but in fact it is merely a discussion of a very refined form of
cost getting, and a branch of the subject which has perhaps been given
too little attention. When the daily output of a job is up to or above
the average, everything looks bright, and no one who is responsible
feels overburdened with care. If, however the output falls too low,
some glaring cause is at once sought, and the fall of output blamed
to some unforeseen circumstance or accident. This is all very well,
as accidents affecting output cannot be entirely avoided, and unforeseen
conditions will make great differences in performance; but the
careful analysis of process cost subdivision will bring about results
that will astonish those "practical men" who think that they have got
their unit-costs down to the lowest point simply because their output<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
is generally large and everyone on the work seems to be working to his
top notch.</p>

<h3 class="p2">OUTPUT</h3>

<p>The reason for compiling the data for which the time-keeper is
responsible, is that, from the analysis of the distribution made, the
contractor is able to tell what work is being done with profit; and, if
any particular operation shows loss, the analysis will help more than
anything else to discover the reason for the loss. In figuring his profit
on any work, the contractor must figure on a unit-cost basis, exactly
the same as he figures when he prepares his bid. In order to do this,
he must have an exact measurement of output. In many classes of
work, this measurement is extremely simple; but in others no little
ingenuity is required to devise a scheme which will give the information
wanted exactly and without requiring much work.</p>

<p>The payment for work is based upon the engineer's estimate.
The <i>monthly estimate</i> is usually more or less a guess, made simply for
the purpose of paying the contractor approximately according to what
he has done. The monthly estimate is generally a pretty fair approximation
of the exact amount of work done; and the <i>final estimate</i> covers
everything included in the contract that has not already been taken
care of.</p>

<p>The contractor's measurements of work done each day should
agree quite closely with the engineer's estimate; but, if the work is
difficult to measure, the contractor has many times more opportunity
of making errors in his measurement by going over it daily than the
engineer has who only goes over it once. A careful consideration of
the differences in the amount of estimates will sometimes show the contractor
how his estimates can be made to balance with those of any particular
corps of engineers, and he can govern his daily measurement
accordingly.</p>

<p>There are few measurements in the field which can be reduced to
a unit, or rather which can be counted directly. Linear measurements
are easy enough to get; the measurement of area is a little more difficult;
while the measurements of volume, especially in rough work, are
often extremely difficult to make in a satisfactory manner. Measurement
by weight is often found to be of great advantage, if proper facilities
can be arranged for weighing.</p>

<p>The measurement of drill output is extremely simple. The holes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
for any one day's work can be marked as they are finished, and, at the
end of the day, all measured; or they can be measured as finished, and
their depth taken, and hence the entire day's work is easily determined.
This, of course, is a linear measurement; and in the same
class would fall such work as laying track, ballasting, grading with a
road machine, and the measurement of the work of track and wheel
scrapers.</p>

<p>The measurement of quantities whose units are areas is only a
little more difficult. Paving, for instance, is very easily measured,
the distance from curb to curb generally being constant, and so really
reducing the measuring to a linear measurement&mdash;that is, the length
of the section of pavement laid. Brick laying, while really a cubical
measurement, is taken in the same way, the area of the face of the wall
laid being taken, and multiplied by the standard number of bricks
to any given thickness of wall. This really reduces the measurement
for brick laying to a unit-basis, the unit being one brick. Painting and
plastering are measured in the same way; and so also is roofing. On
road work, plowing and sprinkling are estimated per unit-area; and
in quarry work, channeling is so estimated.</p>

<p>The determination of volume on construction work is liable to
be very difficult. Take, for instance, the output of a steam shovel
cutting through rock. The walls of the cut will be very irregular both
in line and in slope, no matter how skilfully the shovel is operated;
and the face of the cut is liable to be even more irregular. No absolutely
exact measurement can be made; and for this reason it is common
practice to estimate the contents of the cars rather than attempt
to estimate the size of the pit excavation during any one day. Generally
the size of the pit is roughly measured, and the yardage figured from
this measurement. It is also figured from the number of cars loaded,
and, if carefully done and the estimate of the volume of the cars loaded
is correct, both figures should balance at the end of the month with the
monthly estimate, which, on account of the large volume measured,
can practically ignore such irregularity as would affect the other two
measurements. In earth excavation, the measurement is much simpler,
because the pit is more regular and the cars can be fully loaded.</p>

<p>There are natural working units that lend great simplicity to calculations
of cost&mdash;such, for example, as a floor panel in a building, a
column, a bridge panel, a pier of masonry, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Another unit of measurement is often obtained through the percentage
of a total or of another unit, such as the amount of sand in a
yard of concrete. Knowing the mix, a percentage of the total yardage
of concrete will be the amount of sand that has been moved.</p>

<p>Care should be taken properly to subdivide the units of measurement.
The ordinary unit of concrete work is the cubic yard or the
cubic foot. The mistake is frequently made, of estimating the cost of
forms and of reinforcement only in terms of the cubic yards of concrete.
The cost of forms should be estimated also by the number of
feet, board measure. Reinforcing steel should be estimated by the
pound.</p>

<p>One difficult kind of work to obtain costs on by the regular
method, is the laying of cut stone. A very simple way to obtain this
is to paint on each stone a number, and let the time-keeper get the
dimensions of the stone after it has been cut, before it has been placed
in the wall. Then the stone layer simply records the number of each
stone as it is laid.</p>

<p>A check on the measurement of the quantity of the work done is
frequently obtained by the measurement of the quantity of the work
left undone or of the material remaining in the stock piles.</p>

<h3 class="p2">COST SHOWING</h3>

<p>The object of cost keeping is to furnish accurate and early information
to those in authority, both as to where they stand financially
on the work, and what necessities or opportunities there are for improvement
in economy.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish the object of cost keeping, it is necessary
that there be some efficient method of cost showing; and it is essential
that the system of cost showing, in combination with the system of
cost keeping, shall meet the following specifications:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">1. It shall be accurate.</p>

<p class="pbq">2. It shall be simple.</p>

<p class="pbq">3. It shall be easy to study.</p>

<p class="pbq">4. It shall be easy to compile.</p>

<p class="pbq">5. It shall be capable of being compiled in a very short time after
the receipt of the original figures.</p>

<p class="p1">It needs no argument to prove that the cost-showing system should
be accurate. If it be full of errors, its usefulness is entirely obviated;
and 1 per cent of error in it will do a great deal more than 1 per cent
of damage to its efficiency, in assisting the manager to increase the
efficiency of the work. There is, however, a limit to the desirable precision
of such an affair. The cost of putting in ties on a certain railroad
for a certain month, for instance, may have been 7.2143 cents.
If the last two figures are interesting from the statistician's point of
view, they are utterly useless to a practical manager. If the previous
month's performance has been, we shall say, 6.94 cents per tie, this
month's figures will have shown an increase in cost of O.27 cent, which
is approximately 3.9 per cent of the previous month's figure. In other
words, the tie-placing efficiency has decreased 3.9 per cent. It is very
questionable whether the figure 4 per cent, although not quite so precise,
would not be rather more useful to the manager than the figure
3.9 per cent; and, personally, the authors would favor the briefer work.
The degree of refinement to which these records should be carried, is,
in the last analysis, a matter for the individual judgment of the manager
himself. The student should bear in mind the folly of unnecessarily
elaborate figures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>The second specification, that the cost-showing system shall be
simple, is almost as important as the first. If it be not simple, the
chances for inaccuracy will be tremendously multiplied. It will take
more work to carry it on; and the straightening-out of errors and discrepancies
will be so difficult, and will require so much of the time of
persons in authority, as to leave them no opportunity to do their other
work. Plainly, it should not be necessary for a manager to do a lot of
detailed work on cost-keeping or cost-showing systems himself.</p>

<p>Specifications Nos. 3 and 4 are more or less included in specification
No. 2. Specification No. 5, however, is also of great importance.
Information that is stale is about as useless as no information at all.
If you tell a foreman on Monday that the work of his gang for the week
ending ten days before was not up to the mark, he will not have much
respect for your cost-keeping system; he will certainly not remember
sufficiently well the causes that produced his bad work, to remedy
them; or he will be able to pick out of the haze of history enough
excuses to let himself out of the responsibility of his bad work, and to
put his manager at sea as to where this foreman and his gang really
stand. It is therefore of prime importance that the arrangement
for showing the manager what his costs are, with the salient conditions
affecting such costs, shall be so rapid as to be "red-hot" all the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>The commonest arrangement of cost showing&mdash;and the only one
ordinarily found at the present day on most contract work&mdash;is an
abstract prepared on a piece of yellow paper by the time-keeper for the
inspection of the manager each morning; and this has so few disadvantages
that it would be very satisfactory, were it not that it is impossible
from it to compare at a glance the work done, let us say yesterday, with
that done previously. It is, however, far better than any other system
which lacks any of the essentials indicated above.</p>

<h3 class="p2">USE OF CHARTS</h3>

<p>The best method that has so far been devised is by the use of
charts showing to scale the different unit-costs for the various days in
the month. Such charts are illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8. They are
from the records of the Construction Service Company. One of
these (Fig. 7) indicates the cost of channeling rock. It will be seen from
the line <i>A</i>, that during this month the number of square feet channeled
varied from 75 to 375, and that the labor cost varied from a maximum
of 62 cents to a minimum of 8 cents. On the 8th, the morning
crew did not work, because, as it happened, of severe weather, which
accounted for the low output on that day. On the 24th, the night
shift allowed the pipes to freeze up. It may be mentioned that the
foreman of the night shift, whose name appears in brackets on the
chart, has since turned his attention to other fields of industry than
channeling. On the 28th, the channeler had reached a point where
the cut was frequently filled up by earth that slid in from the side and
caused such a large amount of sludge as to cushion the blows of the
blade; and the chart shows on that day a high cost, due to the cleaning
away of this earth.</p>

<p>The chart illustrated in Fig. 8 is that for steam-shovel work on the
same contract of the Construction Service Company. Line <i>A</i> indicates
the approximate number of yards moved per day. Line <i>B</i> shows the
pay-roll, ranging from $165 to $310 per day, and including a percentage
for incidentals; while line <i>C</i> represents the values of the <i>B</i> quantity
divided by the <i>A</i> quantity, and gives the unit-cost in labor per yard for
excavating and moving rock. It will be noted that the Sundays are
skipped. These came on the 5th, 12th, 19th, and 26th of the month.
There were some men employed on each of these Sundays; but their
time was so distributed over the rest of the month as not to show for
the Sundays, as the steam shovels did not work on that day.</p>

<p>These charts are of a size to be filed in one of the standard loose-leaf
books, and their range is from zero to about 12; thus it is possible
to show any quantity to scale for any day in the month. This company
has not found it of advantage to plot more than 4 lines on any one
chart.</p>

<p>Charts such as these may be marked each morning by the
time-keeper upon a tracing prepared for this purpose; and at the
end of the month the lines connecting the points may be inked in,
and the chart blue-printed and the blue-print filed in a convenient
place for immediate reference.</p>

<p>There are several ways of working out the unit-cost from the
figures, such for example as:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">1. Performance per time unit</p>

<p class="pbq">2. Performance per dollar;</p>

<p class="pbq">3. Cost per unit of performance.</p>

<p class="p1">The first of these is not, properly speaking, a cost statement, although
it is a function of a cost statement and for certain purposes is
more convenient. The number of feet of rock drilled per drill hour,
is a very convenient form for record.</p>

<p>When drilling under conditions of snow and ice, more muckers
have to be employed than at other times. If the cost of mucking is
included in the cost of drilling, as it frequently is, the true index of how
well the drills are getting on is the number of feet per drill hour, rather
than the cost of the operation to the contractor.</p>

<p>The second method is the reciprocal of the third. Other systems
will suggest themselves by virtue of the peculiar requirements of each
case in practice.</p>

<p><b>Checking by Charts.</b> A great advantage of the chart system of
cost showing, is that it acts as an automatic check upon the cost-keeping
system in general. As indicated earlier in this volume, it occasionally
happens that a punch-card is not turned in, or the time-keeper fails
to get certain data. This is immediately discoverable by the gap on
the chart, and thus the chart acts as a check on the cost-getting department.
This will not entirely obviate the necessity for inspection to
ascertain whether the time-cards are properly kept and the work is
properly done.</p>

<p>The showing of costs should be made <i>daily</i> for the men immediately
identified with the field work; they should be made <i>weekly</i> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the general manager, and <i>monthly</i> for the home office. These monthly
office reports are sometimes valuable in the planning of the financial
arrangements for the work. On a job involving, say, a pay-roll of
$5,000 a week, with monthly estimates, early information as to performance
over the month is of very great value.</p>

<p>Showing the men certain charts and records will serve to increase
their interest in their work, but this should not be overdone. It is as
well that the men should not know the actual cost of their work to the
contractor in dollars and cents. If, on the contract price, the contractor
is making a handsome profit, the men want more money. If
the contractor is not making a handsome profit, the men are apt to
think that they are on a losing job, and become discouraged accordingly.
The economy of the contractor's work should be private information,
since it might do him considerable damage by becoming
known to competing contractors. The charts showing the performance
per unit of time, however, are not subject to the restrictions
above mentioned.</p>

<h3 class="p2">COST KEEPING</h3>

<p>In the foregoing there has been nothing that is a part of the
regular bookkeeping, with the exception that part of the time-keeper's
records are necessary to the bookkeeper. It should be appreciated at
the start, that the bookkeeper's work is of great importance, that it
cannot be superseded by a cost-keeping system, and that it should not
be divided up with the cost-keeping system. The scoffers at cost
analysis are inclined to take the ground that a bookkeeper, a cost-keeper,
a cost-analysis engineer, are more or less clumsy substitutes
for managerial intelligence; and they point to the proposition that in
the last analysis it should be easy to let the office boy run the job with
a textbook at one elbow and a calculating machine at the other.</p>

<p>It is insisted upon at the start, that cost keeping is as important
as bookkeeping, but that it has an entirely different function; and in
applying cost keeping to construction work, it is very important that a
distinct line of demarcation be drawn between the two branches.</p>

<p>Another error that is frequently made by antiquarian students,
men who are studying old methods of engineering and construction
rather than those of to-day, is that a cost-keeping system is assumed
to be complete by the man who runs it, when he knows how many
feet of hole his drillers are able to average per hour, per day, or per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
week. The cost analyst will point to the fact that in the literature of
the subject many false statements are made as to the costs of certain
items of work, and will show that no allowance has been made for
depreciation, repairs, etc., not to say profit, interest on the contractor's
money, and a host of other things. The student is warned that a
proper cost-keeping system must of necessity take into consideration
<i>all</i> the items of cost on the job; and, further, it should take them into
account with such detail that it will be a real, living help to a man in
estimating future costs on similar work.</p>

<p>Now, as a general thing, the essential similarity of items has been
lost sight of when these items are parts of work which is not generally
dissimilar. For example, the item of earthwork in the construction
of a large dam may be very similar in its essential cost to, and may
be of the greatest use in assisting a contractor or engineer to figure the
cost of, earthwork under similar climatic conditions on a railroad
embankment; yet those who are most interested in the subject are
inclined to classify dams as an entirely different sort of structure from
railroads. The designing of a dam is a different matter from the
design of a railroad; but to build one will often involve the same kind
of tools, the same kind of machinery, the same kind of men, the same
kind of "horse sense," and the same general principles of construction,
as to build the other. Therefore, if his costs are properly subdivided
and intelligently kept on one kind of construction, the contractor or
engineer will be materially aided, not only in estimating the cost of the
work upon the other, but in being in close touch with his work after
he has started.</p>

<p>Every construction organization ought to have a schedule of
standard items which may be called <i>ledger accounts</i>; and its books
ought to be kept in such a manner that the records of the total and of
the unit-amounts for these items on past work and on current work
may be immediately available for the benefit of its officers. No two
contractors will have the same arrangement for distributing cost; no
two will have the same items for the accounts; but there are certain
fundamental items that will come into use on almost every large
piece of work, and some of them have a peculiar significance, and
should be treated with special care.</p>

<p><b>Estimates on Ledger Items.</b> In making estimates it is important
to have this list in sight, in order that important items may not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
omitted. Such a list, which will cover a large portion of the ordinary
charges, is here given:</p>

<table id="t14" summary="t14">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdr">1.</td>
  <td class="tdc"><span class="smcap">Gang</span></td>
  <td><span class="smcap">Labor:</span></td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td rowspan ="2">&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdc">(<i>a</i>)</td>
  <td>Hourly rate;</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdc">(<i>b</i>)</td>
  <td>Monthly rate.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p>The men who work by the month are apt to have to spend a good
deal of non-productive time, on account of weather conditions, etc.;
while the men who are on an hourly basis, as a general thing, do some
profitable work whenever they are paid. It is feasible to figure a
good deal more closely on the cost of work for those men who have
practically no lost time to be taken care of, as <i>emergencies</i> or <i>incidentals</i>.
It will be noted, also, that the cost and the time of hourly
and daily men can be figured and charted day by day; whereas it is
impossible to know exactly what the charges will be for labor that is
paid by the month, until the end of the month. In order to make
report charts showing cost as completely as possible, it is a frequent
practice to add a certain percentage to the cost of the known items, to
cover the so-called <i>lost foremen's time</i>; and to make at the end of the
month a correction of a greater or less size, in order to make the cost-keeping
end tally with the bookkeeping end of the work.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">General Labor, etc.</span> This item will comprise the labor
of the men who have something to do with more than a few parts of
the work. A watchman's time is not spent in drilling, or on a steam
shovel while it is running. Nevertheless a proportionate part of his
salary should be divided among the different branches of the work.
Sometimes this will be a very small item, sometimes a large item.
For example, if a steam shovel is excavating 30,000 yards of material
per month, the watchman's unit-charge to excavation may be very
small; but if the shovel is tied up for nearly the whole month, the
charge per unit for watchman's time may be alarmingly high. This
is one reason why unit-cost and total cost should always go together.
A blacksmith's time, part of which is spent in sharpening drills, need
not be all chargeable to drilling, because he may spend a good deal of
time in repairing the steam shovel or fixing hand tools, etc.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Overhead Labor.</span> Clerks, bookkeepers, messengers, office
force, and General Manager are ordinarily included among the items of
<i>overhead charge</i>, as well as salaries of general officers.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Overhead Materials.</span> In this classification, there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
included stationery, office furniture, supplies, etc. When the office
furniture is disposed of upon the completion of the work, its value
should be credited upon this item.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Overhead Incidentals.</span> These may include various items,
such as telephone, office rent, telegraph messages, express charges on
incidentals not directly connected with plant, etc.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Preparatory Costs.</span> These include the cost of getting
ready to do the work, and, depending upon the nature of the job, may
include any or all of the following items:</p>

<p class="pnr05 p1">
(<i>a</i>) Temporary roads;<br />
(<i>b</i>) Temporary trestles;<br />
(<i>c</i>) Clearing and grubbing;<br />
(<i>d</i>) Snow removal and drainage;<br />
(<i>e</i>) Traveling expenses to job;<br />
(<i>f</i>) Preliminary estimates, calculations, and surveys;<br />
(<i>g</i>) Freight and handling of materials to and from job;<br />
(<i>h</i>) Freight on preliminary supplies;<br />
(<i>i</i>) Handling of preliminary supplies;<br />
(<i>j</i>) Licenses and premiums on bonds, etc.<br />
(<i>k</i>) Legal expenses;<br />
(<i>l</i>) Loss on initial operations;<br />
(<i>m</i>) Right of way and cost of site;<br />
(<i>n</i>) Sheds, storehouses, and other temporary buildings;<br />
(<i>o</i>) Tools, less final value.</p>

<p class="p1">7. <span class="smcap">Supplies.</span> These are chargeable F. O. B. the job, or at
the railroad station nearest to the work. They include all supplies
for carrying on the work, as distinct from <i>material</i>, including explosives,
coal, oil, waste, etc., and may include a <i>charge for water</i>.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">Interest and Depreciation on Plant.</span> This item is
variously estimated by different people, and may vary greatly. It is
impossible to establish an absolute rule; but on the average contractor's
plant, it may be stated that 1/10 of 1 per cent per working day
is a very fair general average figure. The average steam shovel, for
example, will work perhaps 200 days, under favorable weather conditions;
and on this basis the interest and depreciation charge will be
20 per cent per year, and is not far from a fair figure. Some contractors
allow 33 per cent per year on such material as road machinery,
including crushers, steam rollers, etc. This is a little high, provided
that a reasonable charge is made for repairs.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap">Repairs to Plant.</span> How much money it takes to keep the
equipment in proper condition for performing efficient work, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
question on which the limits of space prevent a detailed discussion.
On such a machine as a standard-gauge steam locomotive in constant
operation to the limit of its capacity, repairs may run as high as 20
per cent per year; and on a rock drill the repairs may be 50 per cent
or more per year.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap">Rent, Stumpage, etc.</span> The item of <i>rent</i> includes the
rental of ground and the storage buildings, if any, outside of the office
expenses. <i>Stumpage</i> is the cost of standing timber, the purchaser
being privileged to leave the stump after cutting down the tree.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap">Materials of Construction.</span> These are chargeable F. O.
B. the job, or at the railroad station nearest to the work.</p>

<h3 class="p2">COST REDUCTION</h3>

<p>The ultimate aim of cost analysis is economic efficiency; and
any system or method of cost analysis which does not result in the
lessening of the total cost per unit of work performed, must necessarily
be a failure.</p>

<p>After the costs on work have been partially analyzed, it becomes
the province of the engineer to introduce methods and devices whereby
the expense of obtaining the various data may be more than offset in
the general economy of the work. It was long ago realized that shop
practice could be economized by methods of systematization; and
we have an early instance of the appreciation of this fact in the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
of the struggles and methods re-sorted to by James Watt in the construction
of the early steam engines. The troubles arising from incompetent
workmen, drunkenness, and the necessity of doing work
in different parts of the country far removed from headquarters, were
as real then as they are now, with this disadvantage, that in the
eighteenth century the press, the telephone, and the professional
schools had not reached a development admitting of intelligent coöperation
in the attack upon this problem.</p>

<p>Within the last score of years it has been found that cost-analysis
applied to shop work problems gives most amazing results. When
the piece-work system was introduced, it was believed that the final
solution of the problem had been attained. The men were then
placed upon the footing of contractors. A man got so much pay for
accomplishing so much work; and it was most clearly to his interest
to accomplish the maximum of work in order to get the maximum of
pay. It was immediately evident that the good men would soon show
such a contrast to the poor men on the work as to inspire a constant
rivalry, thereby resulting in a very much higher output. In order
that the desire to accomplish more work should not interfere with the
quality of the work, all materials were systematically and rigidly
inspected.</p>

<p>For a good many years the piece-work system flourished, and it
is still flourishing as compared with its predecessors. It is vigorously
fought by trades unions and by the less able among the men. It is
tolerated by those of mediocre ability, and it is heartily endorsed by
the most skilful. In order to remove the resistance of labor unions, a
modification of the piece-rate system, known as the <i>bonus system</i>,
has been devised. It will be described in a subsequent paragraph.</p>

<p>Remarkable development has been achieved in the shop by the
most brilliant work on the part of the men who have applied cost
analysis, favored by the fact that in the shop one has conditions of
work which are practically invariable from day to day. It is possible,
then, to compare the work done per unit of time in the morning, with
the work done per unit of time in the afternoon, or for each hour in the
day, and thus to determine the effect of fatigue of the operators upon
their efficiency and the effect of such specific influences as the character
of artificial light, the grade of steel in tools, and even the economic
value of providing reading rooms, white-enameled lavatories, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
recreation for the operatives. To cost analysis has been largely due
the development of the special high-speed steels and an amazing
number of improvements in machinery, entirely aside from the
stimulus and education of the workmen.</p>

<p>In field work, however, comparatively little has been accomplished
in the world at large along these lines, not because the opportunity
is lacking, but because certain of the difficulties appeal more glaringly
to the pioneer in the field, and offer some peculiar discouragements.
The conditions are not uniform from day to day. The
locus of the work is changing, the weather is variable, and a very
large number of external agencies will be continually interfering with
the scheduled regularity of the work. The method or process whereby
a piece of work can be done more economically, may be instituted
at just the time when some apparently trivial variation of the weather,
or breakdown in a water system, or interruption in train service, may
produce an entirely opposite effect which will more than nullify the
advantages obtained from the improved process or method, and will
sometimes cover a period of a good many days and possibly weeks,
making it appear that the improved method is not only a failure but
a dragon in disguise.</p>

<p>Field work is constantly presenting obstacles and difficulties
which have to be met and fought, calling for emergency judgment
on the part of the men in charge and on the part of all the men on the
work to a greater or less extent; and here alone is one of the chief
reasons why a contractor comes to depend almost exclusively upon
the personality of his superintendent or foreman, to the exclusion of
systematic analysis.</p>

<p>It is abundantly demonstrable that when results are properly
charted, and when a careful record is kept of the causes of interruption
and the extent of the accidental obstacles, the problem becomes much
simplified. It is astonishing how intimately a manager may come
into touch in a short time with the obstacles to his work, and with
the most efficient methods for their removal, by means of proper
reports and cost analysis, and especially by the intelligent use of
charts.</p>

<p><b>Effects of Weather.</b> The principal obstruction to economical
construction work in the temperate zone, is due to <i>rain</i>. If it is
raining at about the time when the men come upon the work, they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
rarely fail to retire to their homes or to some point so far from the
scene of operations as to make it difficult if not impossible to get them
back upon the job if the weather should clear.</p>

<p>If a rain comes on in the noon hour, they generally leave and do
not return to work. If it should start to drizzle in the middle of the
afternoon, and the men are under fairly good discipline, they stand a
very good chance to stay the day out rather than miss getting a full
day's pay.</p>

<p>Next to rain as an obstacle is <i>freezing weather</i>. On concrete
work, if the concrete is laid at temperatures below 22 degrees, and
particularly when a slow-setting brand of cement is used, special precautions
have to be taken, and even then the work is liable to be
rejected. For work in which steam engines are employed, as dinkeys,
steam shovels, steam drills, etc., continued cold weather is likely to
result in the freezing of supply pipes, the freezing of valves, and the
breaking of pipe connections, necessitating a good deal of frost protection
and a well-disciplined and well-handled gang of pipe-fitters
under a responsible foreman charged with the express duty of keeping
the water lines clear. In very cold weather&mdash;say below zero&mdash;the
freezing of water will seriously interfere with the economy of the work
on the water end alone. Where steam drills are used and the weather
is exceedingly cold, the steam from the drills blown upon the men
condenses and freezes upon their clothes, involving great inconvenience
and suffering. Under such conditions the men will not work so many
hours per day as otherwise, and frequently they will not work at all at
critical times in the progress of the work, to the great detriment of
economy.</p>

<p>It has been observed that a combination of stress of weather a
few hours before the coming of the paymaster seems to be more discouraging
than at any other time, and it is seized upon as an excuse
to quit work.</p>

<p>In very windy weather, more coal is burned than at other times;
and sometimes a boiler which is capable of running seven or eight
drills in ordinary weather will not be able to furnish steam for more
than 70 or 80 per cent of this amount in the high, cold winds.</p>

<p>For the above reasons it is essential to keep a record of the temperature
and weather.</p>

<p><b>Accidental Conditions.</b> Besides the weather, there are a host of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
accidental conditions that may arise to influence the economy of the
work and complicate a precise study of the performance. Some of
these, named at random, are:</p>


<p class="pbq p1">1. The blowing-out of the gasket in a main water supply pump.</p>

<p class="pbq">2. A shipment of poor coal.</p>

<p class="pbq">3. The wrecking of a trestle.</p>

<p class="pbq">4. A derailment of cars.</p>

<p class="pbq">5. The breaking of machinery on a shovel.</p>

<p class="pbq">6. The burning-out of a boiler, due to carelessness on the part of a
watchman over night.</p>

<p>7. The non-arrival of necessary and important material.</p>

<p class="pbq">8. Irregular blasting, due to irregular spacing of drill holes, or to
bad loading, or to poor detonators or a poor exploding machine, or to irregularity
in the character of the rock itself.</p>

<p class="pbq">9. Erratic action on the part of one or more of the men, due to drunkenness,
ill-temper, or general contrariness.</p>

<p class="pbq">10. Errors on the part of foremen in coöperation, some of which are
not detected in time to be eliminated.</p>

<p class="p1">In working out any special problem, care should be taken that
such accidental causes affecting performance&mdash;whether they decrease
the performance or, as may happen, increase it&mdash;should be carefully
noted and be a part of the regular report on the work. These features
of a report ordinarily are ignored as being unimportant, but they are
of the utmost value to the success of the work.</p>

<h3 class="p2">STIMULATING THE MEN</h3>

<p>The art of persuading a man who is turning out 500,000 foot-pounds
of work in ten hours, to turn out 800,000 foot-pounds of work
in ten hours with a trivial increase in pay, is on its face difficult; but
is by no means impossible, and a list of some of the ordinary means
of doing this should not be out of place here.</p>

<p>1. <b>Watching the Work.</b> If, on the average work under the observation
of a foreman whom they know, the men are made to realize
that their individual performance is being watched and recorded by
someone who is above and beyond their own foreman, there will
usually result an increase in performance of from 10 to 20 per cent
per man; and particularly if a tab is kept upon the performance of the
gang as a whole, the foreman will add his own stimulus to that applied
by the men themselves, resulting in highly increased efficiency.</p>

<p>On such work as teaming, where teams are hauling earth along
a road for a considerable distance, a punch-card is very valuable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
The driver knows that the time of his trip is being recorded and compared
with the time for the same work done by other drivers; and it
has the effect of concentrating his mind upon his performance, which
in itself causes him to use more care in cutting down delays and keeping
his team up to their work.</p>

<p>In the operation of drilling, most valuable results have been
achieved by giving each drill runner a card on which, at the completion
of each hole, the time of the finishing of the hole is punched;
and also the time of starting the new hole, in the same way. This
card will then show the length of time that it took to drill the hole, and
the length of time required to move his drill. He will be stimulated to
move quickly, which in soft rock is an exceedingly important element
of the drilling work, and he will be stimulated in the effort to get his
holes down rapidly.</p>

<p>Where earth or rock is being loaded by steam shovels and hauled
by dinkey trains, great economy can be arrived at by providing each
dinkey runner with a punch-card or a report card on which he indicates
the time when his train left the shovel and when it returned
again to the shovel. This card then indicates the time for a round
trip, and his mind is constantly being stimulated to look out for causes
of delay; and, if he is at all conscientious, as most men are, he will
instinctively attempt to make the best time. Some remarkable
results have been achieved by this means alone in recent work.</p>

<p>When concrete is being mixed by hand, if a record is made of
the time when each batch is finished, there will inevitably be an
increase of activity of all the men in the mixing gang.</p>

<p>2. <b>Discharges.</b> The principle of natural selection of the men
can be very advantageously applied. Where the supply of labor is
adequate, it is advisable to make a rule of discharging a few of the
poorest men every few days, taking on new men to fill their places.
This necessarily results in an increase of the ability of the average
men on the work, and it gives a healthy spur to the men who are not
discharged. In carrying this method out, it should be done judiciously
and with care to avoid discharging good men, lest the discipline
of the work be interfered with. Any man who is not willing
to do his best, or who is caught loafing deliberately, is an economic
disadvantage to the work, and should be allowed to go. Likewise,
any man who with good intentions is so dull as to hinder the progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of the work, should not be retained because of his good intentions
alone.</p>

<p>3. <b>Bonus Systems.</b> An immense advantage can be counted
upon by the employment of a bonus system, of which there are a
good many; and it should be said at the start, that a bonus system
may, although it probably will not, be opposed by labor unions. The
general idea of a bonus system is to place the men upon a contract
footing whereby they will be guaranteed a minimum wage, and more
money than the minimum if they perform unusually good work. A
refinement of this system may be applied where the men receive less
than the guaranteed minimum if their work is noticeably poor. Where
this latter arrangement should be applied, will depend largely upon
the local conditions; and this feature is the one that is peculiarly
obnoxious to the labor unions. Where the supply of labor is adequate,
it is usually better to discharge the inefficient men than to attempt to
work them under a depressed rate.</p>

<p>On a recent piece of work, the steam drills, of which there were 14,
were averaging 4 feet of hole drilled per drill hour, the drillers were
getting 30 cents per drill hour, and helpers 18¾ cents. For a period of
ten days the drills were kept under the personal supervision and
instruction of the expert in charge; and at the end of that time a bonus
of 2 cents per foot for everything above 70 feet in 8 hours was offered
to the men. On this basis no one could get a bonus unless he did
100 per cent better than the average previously attained. Exceedingly
cold weather intervened, preventing a good deal of drilling; but
within two weeks of the return to normal weather conditions, the
average drill output rose to over 6 feet per drill hour, and one man
obtained the remarkable record of 142 feet in 9 hours, or over 15.7 feet
per drill hour. On this work a careful record was kept day by day,
of the performance of each man; and the men who had a consistently
low average were gradually discharged, thereby helping out the bonus
system. The men were also under more or less constant instruction,
and therefore the improvement was not entirely due to the bonus
system.</p>

<p>A further modification of the bonus system is advisable in some
cases, where an extra bonus is given for exceedingly high performance,
such, for example, as paying the men an extra cent bonus, making 3
cents above, say, 90 or 100 feet per 8 hours. It is well, however, to
apply this modified arrangement only after there has been an elimination
of the poorest men. When possible, the payment of bonuses
should be made at very short intervals, and not left to a monthly settlement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <b>Bulletin Board Posting.</b> Posting upon a bulletin board
in the storehouse or office, of the records of performance accomplished
in different parts of the work day by day or week by week,
is a very valuable adjunct to the other methods of stimulation. The
methods above indicated will keep the men on the <i>qui vive</i> during
the day. A very valuable improvement can be instituted if the
more intelligent among them can be led to think about their
work after working hours. This must necessarily be done in rather
a subtle way. Posting records at the end of the day's work so that the
men see them on their way home, will do a great deal toward keeping
the subject alive until the next morning. When the men have been
led to a state where they discuss with each other the methods of
improved efficiency, for the following day amazing results can be
counted upon.</p>

<p>5. <b>Gang and Team Work.</b> If a certain number of men have
been working together under one foreman on one particular piece of
work, they come to know each other's methods and their foreman's
methods intimately; and they necessarily will become very much more
efficient than when they are shifted from gang to gang or when they
have to work under different foremen. If the record of the performance
of each individual gang can be obtained, and the men, as well as the
foreman, are acquainted with the record, a spirit of rivalry between
the gangs can be developed which will add greatly to efficiency. In
making such a record, inasmuch as the gangs are likely to vary in size,
it is necessary to have a unit of performance that will be independent
of the number of men in the gang. It will be found that, shortly
after the application of this principle, the men are themselves making
suggestions as to improvements in method; and frequently their suggestions
are immensely valuable.</p>

<p>6. <b>High Pay.</b> Some contractors have found it economical to
pay a little more than the prevailing rate of wages, thereby attracting
to their organization the best of the labor available. As a general
thing, a man is perfectly willing to do 10 per cent more work for 5 per
cent more pay per hour; and the difference in men is so great as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
make it more than well worth while to secure the very best of the
labor obtainable.</p>

<p>7. <b>Prompt Pay.</b> Men will work very much more contentedly
when they can count upon their pay with promptness and regularity.
There is nothing that demoralizes a piece of construction work more
than the postponement of a pay-day. Special care should be taken
that each man's pay is accurate. A man will seldom be over-paid
unless there is "graft" on the job, but it sometimes happens that
through errors on the part of the time-keeper or bookkeeper a man's
pay is short, much to the agony of the man himself.</p>

<p>8. <b>Early Hours.</b> A good deal of money is lost by the men not
starting to work promptly at the commencing hour, and by quitting
before the final hour. On a recent piece of work that had to be drastically
reorganized, an entire blasting gang rested on their shovels for
over one hour, because their foreman had decided to quit without
notice, and the man who was supposed to be in charge of the work
arrived late himself, and was detained at the other end of the job.
On this particular piece of work, it was not the habit to blow a whistle
at the commencing or the quitting hour, and the men started work in
the morning and quit work in the evening according to their own timepieces.
It was noted that nobody on the whole job quit a minute after
he should have quit, or started a moment earlier than he was paid to
start.</p>

<p>In factory work it is feasible to have all the men go through a gate
which is closed one minute after the hour and not opened again for
perhaps 25 minutes, so that, if a man is two minutes late, he loses a
half-hour's pay. This has the merit of not working injustice to anyone,
and, after being instituted, seems to be accepted by the men with
a reasonable degree of contentment. It is not easy to start a strike
because some men lose their jobs from being late.</p>

<p>Such a system as this, however, is practically impossible on outside
contract work; and while it may be feasible to institute a modification
of the time clock method, it is not known that this has yet
been successfully done. Probably the most satisfactory way of insuring
prompt arrival of the men, is to measure the output of each gang
and make each foreman responsible for it, thus giving him a personal
incentive to get his men on the job promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>9. <b>Enough Foremen.</b> It is necessary, in any organization,
to have the chain of responsibility lead through a sufficient number of
foremen; otherwise a superintendent or supervisor will find himself
"spreading out too thin," and will be attempting to perform a lot of
work that should be done by a foreman. One superintendent can
supervise the work of 20 or 30 foremen with a favorable layout, and
each foreman can supervise the work of from 10 to 25 men. If, however,
there be more gangs than there are foremen, the superintendent
will find himself trying to play the part of foreman in instructing the
men, and not able to do his own work, which is to instruct and supervise
the foremen. In the matter of drilling, a number of able managers
are not in favor of having a foreman over the drills. It is calculated
that by substituting a boy to keep the records of the drilling, and
putting bonuses on the drills, the difference between the pay of a foreman
and the pay of a boy is saved, with no appreciable loss in performance.</p>

<p>There are strong grounds for the opinion that there should be no
process, such as drilling, without a foreman, where the work is on a
large scale. When 10 drills are working, they will employ altogether
20 men on the drills, a number of muckers clearing the ground, and
a pipe man. The work of these men cannot fail to be improved by
their being at all times under the watchful eye of a man to whom they
are responsible for the quantity and quality of their work. Aside from
this, if the foreman is an expert driller, the instruction that he can
give to the less able of the drill runners will be worth ten times its cost.</p>

<p>The same argument applies to all processes in the field.</p>

<p>10. <b>Education on the Work.</b> As a general thing, men who take
money for their labor are more than willing to deliver a square deal to
their employer; and it will almost invariably be found that the more
familiar a man is with the difficulties and possibilities of his fellow-workmen,
the more efficient he will be himself. For this reason it has
been found highly satisfactory, in some lines of work, to change the
men around on the job. In a certain concrete building 12 stories high,
the upper stories were built in a small fraction of the time required
for the corresponding lower stories. The greater part of the extraordinary
increase in efficiency was attributed to the fact that the men were
so educated that a man at the top of the building knew how the men
at the mixer and in other parts of the job were doing their work, and
knew that the superintendent in charge was measuring the speed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the deliveries from the hoist. The disadvantage of this method is
that it takes a long time to work up the efficiency. It is, however, an
admirable method for disciplining an organization.</p>

<p><b>Discipline.</b> To the practical man, or to the intelligent student,
there seems to be no necessity for arguing in favor of <i>discipline</i> as an
essential to economical field work; but so large a percentage of contract
work in the field is badly disciplined, and the general principles seem
to be unknown to so many field organizations, that a brief statement
of them appears to be called for in this volume.</p>

<p>By <i>discipline</i> is meant the cultivation of a spirit of:</p>

<p class="pnr05 p1">1. Co-operation;<br />
2. Obedience;<br />
3. Responsibility;<br />
4. Personal loyalty.</p>

<p class="p1">The subject will be discussed on the basis of <i>reorganization of
work</i>, because here the chief difficulties are met.</p>

<p>The three types of organization that are most clearly defined in
the way of discipline, are those of a <i>military nature</i>, <i>railroad work</i>,
and <i>factory work</i>.</p>

<p>On construction work, it is not feasible to introduce a military
form of discipline. In the first place, the penalties of the military service
are not permissible; and in the second place it is not usually practicable
to have so thorough a system of distribution of responsibility;
while in the third place the same men are not here together for a long
enough period to make military discipline practicable.</p>

<p>In railroad work a man is usually employed for a long term of
years, on rather small pay, with a large chance of promotion. From
the day of his initiation on the work, he is impressed profoundly with
the necessity of protecting lives and of keeping trains moving all the
time; and, in a short time, he comes to the frame of mind in which his
pay, his personal convenience, and his personal prejudice are subordinate
interests. The initials of the superintendent on a little slip of
paper are sufficient to make him do almost anything within the limit
of endurance; and, as a general thing, he does it ungrudgingly (but
not uncomplainingly), and with a cheerfulness that is in many respects
astonishing.</p>

<p>Such a degree of discipline is entirely feasible on any contract
work of long duration, and it should be obtained if economy is desired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
It is not possible to institute successfully radical reforms and methods,
without first securing good discipline on the work; and when work is
badly disorganized, the discipline should be the first point of attack.</p>

<p>It is necessary to have, first, a system of locating responsibility.
If a dinkey becomes derailed, if the spacing of drill holes be erroneously
made, if a steam shovel be out of line, if the wrong methods of
loading be pursued, if a pump be out of order, if necessary material
or supplies be wanting, if the pipes freeze up, if, in short, one hundred
and one little things happen that cause confusion on the work, it
should be possible to find someone who, by some crime of omission or
commission, is responsible for the trouble, and who can be made, in
some degree at least, to bear the brunt of it. The only man who
seems destined to be entirely free from the consequence of his mistakes,
is the clerk of the Weather Bureau.</p>

<p>The organization should be laid out from the bottom upward,
rather than from the top downward. The laborer is responsible practically
for carrying out the instructions of his foreman to the satisfaction
of his foreman and of no one else, and for this reason he should not
work under the impression that anyone except his own foreman is
likely to discharge him, to criticise him, or to praise him. If his foreman
be the right sort of man, the laborer, with his dozen associates,
will have at heart, besides the interests of the work, a strong feeling of
personal loyalty to the foreman; and this feeling will be reciprocated
by the foreman. If a foreman be noticed vigorously complaining
that the men he has to deal with are inefficient, incompetent, and a
disgrace to civilization compared to the men he had to work with some
years before, he may as a general thing be put down as a "blow-hard"
and of little value to the organization. The most successful are
usually the ones who are ordinarily quiet, cool under emergency, and
yet of sufficient determination to inspire among the men a wholesome
respect for them. A man who loses his temper on the work for any reason,
does not, as a general thing, make a good foreman or superintendent.</p>

<p>The relations obtaining between the men and their foreman,
should obtain to a more marked degree between the foreman and their
superintendent. Briefly stated, every man on the job should have
to look for orders from one man and only one man; and he should be
responsible to that man for the satisfactory performance of those orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Conflicting orders can be avoided only by systematic compliance
with the rule just above outlined.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens after periods of financial depression, or as
a result of special conditions, that it is feasible to reduce the pay of a
good many men on the work. This should always be done with great
care and after an intimate knowledge has been obtained of the personalities
of the men affected. As a general thing, if you cut down a
man's pay 10 per cent, you will cut down the work 20 per cent, at least
for a time; and it frequently happens that after such a pay reduction,
small, petty depredations on the work are committed. Articles get
stolen; machinery is damaged by "sore heads." It is usually unwise
to reduce the pay of a few men. As a general policy, where a small
percentage of the working force is to be affected, it is better to discharge
a few men outright, and endeavor by economic methods to
increase the output of the others.</p>

<p>Differential pay is a prolific source of trouble, and it is very common.
By this is meant the payment to different men of different rates
for the performance of the same work. The men who obtain the less
pay think that their pay ought to be raised; and the man who gets the
most pay can in no probability appreciate the fact that he may be
over-paid. Rather than cut his pay down, it is well, if possible, to
put him at some other class of work.</p>

<p>It is often necessary for economical reasons to place men who
have been paid by the month, upon an hourly basis; and even when
by this they average rather more than they formerly received, it usually
causes discontent. Any man likes to know how he is coming out at
the end of the month regardless of the weather, and it is an additional
source of anxiety to him not to know what his pay envelope will contain.
When he keeps his own record of the hours worked, he is likely
to disagree with the time-keeper, and this can lead to a good deal of
disaffection and dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>A frequent cause of disaffection on work is due to the habit too
often indulged in by time-keepers, of gossiping with the men. The
time-keeper and the storekeeper necessarily come into contact with a
very large percentage of the men every day; and if the time-keeper
particularly be disposed to gossip, he has abundant opportunity to
gratify his desire, and can produce a great deal of trouble. For this
reason the general character of the time-keeper should be carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
scrutinized before employing him; and he should be cautious, when
making his rounds, to confine himself strictly to business. If the men
on the job know as much about the work as the General Manager, if
they know all the ins and outs and ups and downs of the contract,
they necessarily discuss it among themselves, and a great deal of restlessness
is produced, which is very difficult to stamp out, because, by
the time it has reached a pronounced stage, the men have learned so
much about the politics, as it were, of the job, as to interfere with the
discipline.</p>

<p>If there be dissensions at headquarters, if the parties that control
the work are at war, and if the methods and performance of the manager
or superintendent be not absolutely satisfactory to every one of the
officials, nothing can be worse than to let a suspicion of this matter
get around among the men. How a general manager or superintendent
can prevent this, if an officer be disposed to talk, is a problem
that no attempt will here be made to solve. In reorganization, such a
condition is one for which the manager should be continually on the
alert, and he is advised to be suspicious of the time-keeper and storekeeper.</p>

<p><b>Labor-Saving Devices Involving Plant.</b> If the men are in a reasonably
good state of discipline, it is feasible to make changes in the
layout involving special apparatus or plant; and in deciding upon such
measures, a question arises as to how much money it is justifiable to
spend for a new plant. A piece of work under reorganization is ordinarily
a piece of work that is more or less in financial difficulties, and
the purchase of plant for the economizing of the work is usually looked
upon by the officers as a dangerous move. Particularly is this the case
when any changes of this kind turn out to be unsuccessful. A small
amount of money wasted on special apparatus is always in sight&mdash;at
the scrap heap, if nowhere else&mdash;whereas a good deal of money wasted
in fruitless labor can be easily lost to view.</p>

<p>If the amount of saving on a certain operation by the installation
of special material be sufficient to pay for this material in a few weeks,
the purchase of the material can be immediately justified, and the cost
of the apparatus can be charged as <i>current expenses</i> to be shortly
recovered in the economy of the work. Where expensive and heavy
machinery is to be installed, however, the matter should be gone into
with the greatest care and detail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>A few of the articles which come within the class chargeable to
<i>current expenses</i>, are:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">1. The use of water jets for increasing the speed of drilling in soft
rock.</p>

<p class="pbq">2. The use of hickory wands for stirring up sludge in drill holes, and
increasing the speed of drilling.</p>

<p class="pbq">3. The use of special explosives and good exploding machines, and of
loading tubes for blasting.</p>

<p class="pbq">4. Small grading machines for spreading earth and macadam.</p>

<p class="pbq">5. Special wheelbarrows or carts for moving material.</p>

<p class="pbq">6. Special small tools for the blacksmith, including a trough in which
he can set his bits to be hardened, with the points in the water.</p>

<p class="pbq">7. A sufficient supply of picks and shovels.</p>

<p class="p1">Some of the items of plant that may be classed in the other category,
are:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">1. Special wagons and scrapers for hauling earth.</p>

<p class="pbq">2. Concrete mixers especially adapted to the work in hand.</p>

<p class="pbq">3. Derricks.</p>

<p class="pbq">4. Locomotive cranes.</p>

<p class="pbq">5. Cableways.</p>

<p class="pbq">6. Bit-sharpening machines.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Labor-Saving Devices Involving No Plant.</b> Where the labor
preparatory to introducing the improved methods is considered, it
should be taken as equivalent to a plant charge as affecting the
interest of the contractor. If, for example, it has been the practice
to drill and blast immediately in front of a steam shovel on rock excavation,
and it is desired to have the drilling and blasting so far ahead
of the shovel as to avoid the occasional necessity of holding up the
shovel, the money involved in the work done ahead should be considered
in the nature of a temporary investment and charged to money
expended on plant which will not come back for a period of perhaps
one month.</p>

<p>A steam-shovel crew has a good deal more pride in its work, and
will continue working under more disagreeable weather conditions,
than a drilling gang; and when drilling in front of a shovel, severe
weather conditions may cause the drilling work to stop without interrupting
the operation of the shovel. If, then, the drills are working
too close to the shovel, the shovel may catch them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is unwise to blast far ahead of the shovel,
for a number of reasons. In the first place, there is no advantage in
investing money in drill holes, except to avoid such a contingency as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
outlined above. In the second place, it is impossible to tell how effective
the blasting has been until the shovel has attacked the broken rock;
and if the blasting is done far ahead of the shovel, poor blasting may go
undetected until an immense amount of financial damage has been
done.</p>

<p>To cite a specific instance&mdash;On a recent piece of important work,
a cut several hundred feet long was drilled to a depth of supposedly
fourteen feet, and blasted with more or less unsatisfactory results.
The steam shovel was then put in, and excavated to a depth of five or
six feet. The subsequent cut of from eight to nine feet deep had to
be entirely re-drilled and re-blasted. The drilling in the already
partly broken rock was immensely difficult, the drills sticking a great
deal and a good many of the holes having to be abandoned; while the
blasting was unsatisfactory because of the fissures.</p>

<p>The rapid reorganization of work can be furthered by the issuance
of <i>special instructions to foremen in the field</i>. This practice has been
admirably followed by Frank B. Gilbreth, and is described in his
"Field System." As illustrations of such orders, are the following
to drill and blasting foremen, issued on some recent work:</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">INSTRUCTIONS TO FOREMEN</p>

<p class="pbqn"><span class="smcap">Rules for Drilling</span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq">Drill foremen are requested to do their utmost to enforce the following
rules for drilling:</p>

<p class="pbq">1. Each drill at the beginning of a hole is to be supplied with a
complete set of sharp bits and a pump, which will be laid alongside of the
drill tripod by the drill tender, under the directions of the foreman.</p>

<p class="pbq">2. As soon as a hole is finished, one of the muckers at the direction
of the foreman will assist the two drill runners to move the tripod;
and the mucker under the direction of the foreman will then pump out
the hole that has just been completed.</p>

<p class="pbq">3. The foreman will then personally, with a wooden rod, measure
the depth of the hole, and punch said depth on the drillers' card, the mucker
placing a well-made round plug in the hole and hammering it home.</p>

<p class="pbq">4. Foremen will see that the drills are so distributed as to keep them
as near as possible to the manifold, from which the steam supply is taken.</p>

<p class="pbq">5. Pipe connections are to be made by a pipe-fitter who will be assigned
to each drill gang, and who may be assisted by the foreman and by
a mucker when necessary. No pipe-fitting is to be done by drill runners
or helpers unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class="pbq">6. The time for drilling is from 8 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> until noon, and from 12.30 until
4.30 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>; and the moving of the dinkey supplying the drills with steam
is never to be done within those hours, unless absolutely necessary, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
when it is necessary, a note to that effect must be made on the quarry
card.</p>

<p class="pbq">7. Whenever for any reason the drills are out of steam, the drill foreman
will indicate the time when the steam pressure failed and the time
when pressure was again turned on, with a reason why the pressure gave out.
This to be written on the quarry card.</p>

<p class="pbq">8. Foremen will see that each drill is in proper working order, and
supplied with an exhaust pipe of the proper length and with a throttle.
Whenever for any reason a drill is not in perfect condition, the foreman will
immediately report it and make requisition through the storekeeper for
the necessary parts and repairs.</p>

<p class="pbq">The attention of all concerned is particularly called to these rules, the
enforcement of which is essential to the economic performance of the work;
and all concerned are particularly urged to make a most earnest effort to
see that, as far as it is possible, every drill on the work shall be in actual
operation for 8 hours on every working day.</p>

<p class="pbq">By order of,</p>

<p class="pn40r"><span class="smcap">Richard T. Dana</span>, General Manager.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">INSTRUCTIONS TO FOREMEN</p>

<p class="pbqn"><span class="smcap">Rules for the Guidance of Blasting Foremen</span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq">Blasting foremen are requested to do their utmost to enforce the following
rules for the conduct of blasting operations:</p>

<p class="pbq">1. Attention is called to the fact that dynamite will freeze in about
45° temperature, and that at this temperature, a little above or a little
below, dynamite is exceedingly sensitive to shocks, and should be handled
accordingly.</p>

<p class="pbq">2. Whenever a part of the charge in a hole has been exploded, leaving
any unexploded dynamite in the hole, do not under any circumstances
blow out the unexploded dynamite with a steam jet. You may, however,
put a stick of dynamite down into the hole on top of the unexploded powder
and endeavor to fire the entire hole in this manner.</p>

<p class="pbq">3. The blasting foreman will provide himself with a measured wooden
rod for tamping, and personally see that every hole that is loaded is down
to grade. If he should find any hole that is not down to grade, he will
immediately report the fact to the superintendent or assistant superintendent
on the work, and make a note of the same on his time-card.</p>

<p class="pbq">4. The attention of the foreman is called to the fact that dynamite
is not as efficient in a hole full of water as it is in a dry hole, and every
effort should be made to load the holes as dry as possible.</p>

<p class="pbq">5. The tamping of the holes should be of the heaviest and stickiest
clay that can be obtained, and this tamping should extend the entire length
of the hole above the powder.</p>

<p class="pbq">6. Never thaw dynamite in front of the fire, or on a hot stone removed
from a fire, or by piling sticks in a boiler or in an oven.</p>

<p class="pbq">By order of,</p>

<p class="pn40r"><span class="smcap">Richard T. Dana</span>, General Manager.</p>

<p class="p1">In hauling earth, the principal elements of team expense are the
time to haul and the standing still to load. This last item can be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
materially reduced by the simple expedient of having on the work an
extra wagon or two. A team can be changed from one wagon to another
in about one and a-half minutes, and the same number of teams
on a short haul will do easily 15 per cent more work by this trick.</p>

<p>The same principle applies to the mixing of concrete involving
extra wheelbarrows; and here it may be mentioned that the arrangement
of the concrete platform is seldom economical. The men, if
left to themselves, will usually not have sufficient runways, so that a
man with a loaded wheelbarrow will be painfully struggling up a plank,
while a man with an empty wheelbarrow is waiting for him to get out
of the way. Much can be accomplished by having the men move in
procession so that no man with a wheelbarrow will ever have to stand
and wait for another man to get out of his way. Of course the ideal
method of handling concrete into a mixer is to do it from bins with
chutes; but the great majority of this class of work is not done in this
manner.</p>

<p>On contract work, the emergency charges for the moving of plant
are usually considerably higher than they ought to be, owing to the fact
that the work is done by men who are not especially skilful in this kind
of work. The direction of these processes should be given to a man
who is especially good at it; and the work should be provided with a
good supply of gin poles, snatch blocks, tackle, etc.</p>

<p>If a piece of work has been under personal observation for considerable
time, a great many sources of improvement in the performance
can be detected that are entirely invisible upon casual inspection;
and the student of economics is urged to devote a large amount of
time to the most careful and complete study of minor and apparently
trivial operations. Too much respect is usually given to established
methods, just because they are established methods; and the analysis
of a process that is apparently simple and of minor importance, but
which is repeated scores of times in a day, is nearly always given too
little importance as compared with the process that is elaborate and
complicated, and which may in itself be of great importance, but which,
on the particular work at hand, is dependent upon apparently minor
processes. To illustrate&mdash;A shovel, loading eight or nine thousand
yards of rock per month, was inspected; and the first impression
obtained was that the reason the shovel output was so small was because
of the inefficient layout of the shovel work itself. It was found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
however, that the shovel was actually able to work a good deal faster
than the drills and the blasting could provide broken rock for it; and
the ultimate solution of the problem was found in the reorganizing of
the drilling, in order to do more work with the same number of drills,
and in the use of improved methods in blasting. The handling of the
shovel took care of itself as soon as the other problems were solved.</p>

<p>The cost of spreading broken macadam on a road, to the average
contractor, is not far from 12 cents per cubic yard; and the work is
done with shovels and forks. This method is one that has been pursued
for a great many years; and there are very few contractors who
realize that it is exceedingly expensive. Some contractors, however,
are doing work of this kind with the aid of a road machine that requires
for its operation two or three men and four horses. A small grader
machine that can be operated by one man and two horses for rough
spreading, assisted by one man on the ground with a potato hook,
has been known to do this work for about 2 cents or less per cubic yard.</p>

<p>In bridge-erecting work, a great deal of money can be saved over
ordinary methods by the designing of special tools, such as dolly bars;
and a good system of keeping detailed cost on such work will be sure to
result advantageously. Much labor is lost in the erecting of roof
trusses and in the erection of trusses in general, by crude and old-fashioned
methods. The pneumatic riveter which strikes a great
many light blows per minute has revolutionized field riveting; but the
use of such a machine for cutting rivets has been unsuccessful in competition
with hand labor on at least one large piece of work in New
York City.</p>

<p>In painting, considerable time is ordinarily lost by the painters
in preparing their own staging. Whenever possible, these preparations
should be done for them under the direction of a skilled man;
and the use of small winches on the staging whereby the painters can
quickly raise and lower themselves, has been found of great value.</p>

<p>On contract work, the blacksmith is in a position peculiar to himself.
He is classed as an expert, paid by the month, and is supposed
somehow to get all the work done that comes to him. He has general
charge of his department, and he gets very few orders and practically
no instruction from the superintendent or manager. He is nearly
always an interesting personality, and, outside of a very limited field,
extraordinarily ignorant. The excuse on a great deal of uneconomical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
work is that it is impossible to get a competent blacksmith who knows
how to do the work that he is called upon to perform. Tools will not
hold their edge, or they break. Upon the matter being referred to the
blacksmith, he will usually come back with a complaint about his coal,
or the grade of steel with which he is supplied, or his tempering solution,
or the condition of his forge. He should be provided with a thoroughly
good set of tools, and the superintendent should know that his
tools are of the best. He should next be carefully and thoroughly
instructed as to how to harden and temper steel. A convenient shop
for the blacksmith, and proper methods of forging and tempering, will
add incalculable value to the organization.</p>

<p><b>Introduction of New Methods.</b> It should be adopted as a cardinal
principle, that there are no methods in the field which are not capable
of improvement along the line of economy; and it should be remembered
that a very small improvement in any one method is
invariably worth a great deal of thought and time in arriving at it.
The systematic perusal of the proceedings of the engineering societies
and the engineering press, will result in the suggestion of new and
improved methods and of a good many bad and unimproved methods;
and the trained expert should be able to sift the wheat from the
chaff, and apply only such as will fit his special needs.</p>

<p>The literature of shop development and shop economics is rich
in illustrations and suggestions that can be adapted to field work, and
should be gone over very carefully for this purpose. In this connection
it should be urged that it is a duty of a professional man to
publish new methods. There is no room for argument on the proposition
that the principle of free trade, showing the other fellow two
blades of grass growing where one grew before, is an advantage to all
concerned.</p>

<p><b>Design of New Methods.</b> When there is crying need for improved
methods in the field on account of special necessity, it behooves the
man in charge to invent improved methods and design improved
apparatus. The cardinal elements of such design include the
following:</p>


<p class="pbq p1">1. Simplicity.</p>

<p class="pbq">2. Low first cost, so that if the experiment is not successful, nothing
will be lost.</p>

<p class="pbq">3. The use of standard sizes of material.</p>

<p class="pbq">4. Generality of application.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Whenever possible, a new method or a new machine should be
so constructed as to apply to as large a proportion of the whole
work as possible, and every effort should be made toward the standardization
of materials and apparatus.</p>

<p>In attempting work in blasting, it should be remembered that the
use of new and untried explosives is attended with peculiar dangers.
The men are familiar with the use of the standard grades of powder;
and while they are ignorant of how dangerous it is to take liberties
with dynamite, they are at a great disadvantage when a new explosive
is given to them for trial. If it looks like dynamite and is exploded
with the ordinary detonating cap, its peculiarities do not receive
much attention.</p>

<p>Men in the field are instinctively opposed to new ideas, and it
will invariably be found that new methods meet with stubborn opposition.
A foreman to whom a new method is suggested will not expect
it to be successful, particularly if he has ever heard it condemned;
and it always seems as if the thought were father to the wish, for, when
ordered to try it in the field, if he can make it fail, he will do so with
unerring accuracy. As a general thing, however, when it is successfully
demonstrated, he will become a loyal supporter of it. In presenting
a new method to a foreman or superintendent, it is well not
to encourage the raising of objections. It is better to let the objections
raise themselves in the application of the process; and a man who has
not gone on record as saying that in his opinion a new scheme
is no good, is a much more loyal supporter of the new scheme
than when he has committed himself against it.</p>

<p>One of the difficulties in improving the efficiency of work, is
the extraordinarily ingenious line of excuses that the men will present
for not getting their work done properly. Of these, perhaps the most
hard-worked is that of improper and insufficient material. When
a man is berated for poor work, and presents the argument that he
was unable to do so and so because he ordered material for it several
weeks previously and the material has not yet arrived, the situation is
embarrassing. The best preventive of this is to have small requisition
blanks measuring about 2½ by 4½ inches, made up into pads of about
fifty each, and to give each foreman a pad. Each blank should have
a space for the date, the articles ordered, the time when the article is
needed, the particular part of the work where the article is needed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the class of work for which the article is needed, and the foreman's
name. The foreman should then be instructed that material
will be purchased through the storekeeper, and that non-delivery
of material will not be accepted as an excuse. The storekeeper
should then go around a job at least once a day, and get from the
foremen their requisition slips; and an intelligent storekeeper will see
to it that useless and unnecessary material or superfluous material
is not ordered. Material that is ordered on requisition, and is not in
the storehouse, should be purchased if necessary on a rush order,
because, contrary to the ordinary apparent belief, it is economical to
spend a dollar for material in order to save two dollars in labor.</p>

<p><b>The Field Layout.</b> In laying out the plan of campaign on starting
a new piece of work, it is important to consider the proposition from
the capitalization end, as well as from that of pure construction. It
is usually not appreciated by the engineer or the owner, that the contractor
is doing a piece of delicate financiering, for the performance
of which his own available money is usually inadequate, and that he
is therefore obliged to borrow money on the work as it goes along,
and to depend upon his monthly estimates. It is sometimes specified
in the contract, that the contractor shall own all of his plant in fee, but
it may be said that this arrangement is seldom lived up to. He can
in addition nearly always borrow the amount of his pay-roll a month
in advance, from his bank. He can also sometimes borrow money,
giving as security his interest in the money retained on the contract,
which is ordinarily something like 10 per cent. Therefore, provided
that all goes well, if he gets his estimates when they are due, if his pay-roll
is not more than the amount of his monthly estimate, and if no
very large and disastrous contingencies interfere with the progress of
the work, the contractor can swing a large piece of work with a comparatively
small capital. If, however, things do not go well; if,
through the failure of the owner's engineer, or through the insolvency
of the owner, or through liens and attachments upon the work brought
by dissatisfied creditors, the contractor does not receive his monthly
estimates on time; if, in order successfully to prosecute the work, it is
necessary for him to buy a large amount of additional machinery at a
time when payments on old machinery are due; or if the portion of
the work that he is doing is bringing him in less than the amount of
his pay-roll and immediate materials and supplies, unless he has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
large capital back of him, which capital is at once available, he is
liable to be placed in an exceedingly embarrassing position. At such
a time, if there should come a period of financial stringency, bankruptcy
may stare him in the face, even though he has at the same time
a contract on which he can be reasonably sure of making a large profit.</p>

<p>It is therefore of great importance that the work be prosecuted
in such a manner as to have a continuous running profit, if possible.
A contractor may turn in what is known as an <i>unbalanced bid</i>. In
that event it will be very easy for him to start a certain portion of the
work upon which he will lose money before he reaches the portion
on which he expects to make money. Unless, as above indicated, the
contractor is provided with a large fund for contingencies, great care
should be taken to avoid this. The nature of unbalanced bids will be
explained below.</p>

<p>As a case in point, on a certain contract involving over a million
dollars, the company that was organized to conduct the work was
provided with a small working capital, bought its plant on a time
basis, and proceeded with a small working capital, under the impression
that it would not be necessary to borrow any money, that the work
immediately commenced would be sufficient to pay all the expenses and
leave a profit, which profit would gradually accumulate and enable a
running fund to be maintained which would take care of future contingencies.
The idea was admirable. It happened that the work
was in earth and rock excavation also known as <i>unclassified</i>, and was
taken at a price which would admit of a large profit in any event. The
rock work, if taken economically, would cost more than the contract
price; the earth work, if taken economically, would cost considerably
less than the contract price. The original plan contemplated starting
the earth excavation at a point to which another contractor was to
excavate, and it was not deemed feasible to commence the earth
excavation until the other contractor had cut up to the line between
the two contracts. Dependence was placed upon the other contractor
doing his work on time, which he did not do; and it was then decided
that it would be impracticable to commence in the earth, and work was
accordingly commenced in rock, which work was conducted at a considerable
loss. The strong financial position of the contracting company
was the only thing that prevented it from going to the wall with a most
excellent contract partly completed and a lot of good money tied up.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall assume, for purposes of illustration, that a certain contractor
desires to bid on some public work involving the removal of
100,000 cubic yards of earth work and 50,000 cubic yards of rock
work. He estimates that he can do the earth work for 30 cents per
cubic yard, or $30,000, and rock work for 80 cents per cubic yard, or
$40,000, making a total of $70,000 for the entire 150,000 yards, or
46.66 cents per yard for an average of the earth and rock; and he puts
in his bid at this figure.</p>

<p>If the contract has been obtained as one of the Erie Barge Canal
contracts, the work will be let <i>unclassified</i>, as it is called. By this
is meant that no discrimination in monthly estimates will be made
between rock and earth removed; that the earth and rock removed
will be measured in excavation, and the contractor will be paid for
these two materials indiscriminately. Now, we shall assume that he
can make a profit of 4 cents per yard on the earth, and 10 cents per
yard on the rock, so that his total profit on the contract will be $9,000.
According to the terms of his contract, he will be paid on the monthly
estimates 46.66 cents per yard removed, less 10 per cent&mdash;or 42 cents,
the 10 per cent being retained until the completion of the contract.</p>

<p>Suppose, now, that he starts in on the rock, and he excavates
the 50,000 yards at a cost to him of $35,000.00 for which he will
receive 42 cents per yard, or $21,000.00. He will then be out of
pocket $14,000.00; but there will be coming to him as held by the
State $2,333.33.</p>

<p>Before he can begin to "see daylight" on his contract, he must
proceed to excavate earth until he has made up the $14,000.00. He
gets 42 cents in cash, and it costs him 26 cents, so that he must excavate
87,500 yards of earth, for which he will get the $14,000.00, and
he will have held up $4,083.33 additional. There will then be remaining
12,500 yards to be excavated on which he will get $5,250.00, with
$583.33 held back. He will have been obliged to do 91⅔ per cent
of his contract before he stops putting money into it; and the money
that he has put into it he will not be able to draw interest on, because
he will not be drawing interest on the 10 per cent retained. The
amount of money that he had to put up to cover shortage on his contract
will have been $14,000.00, on which he will have to pay interest
to his bank. If, on the other hand, he commences the earthwork
first, he does 100,000 yards of earthwork, costing him 26 cents, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
which he gets back immediately 42 cents, and he has $16,000 for
working capital, in addition to $4,666.66 held up. He then does the
rock work, and the rock work never exhausts his capital, and he
has no interest to pay except on his plant, which he can easily do
out of his $16,000.</p>

<p>This is not only a practical problem in how to handle a contract
without being wiped out financially, but it is an exceedingly important
one as defining where the ultimate success in the operation lies.
It can readily be seen that when a contract is taken on close figures, the
entire success of the financial operation will depend upon the proper
layout, as indicated above.</p>

<p><b>Unbalanced Bids.</b> We shall assume again, for purposes of illustration,
that a certain contractor desires to bid on some public work
involving the removal of 100,000 cubic yards of earthwork and 50,000
cubic yards of rock work. He estimates that he can do the earthwork
at a profit for 30 cents per cubic yard, or $30,000; and rock work
for 80 cents per cubic yard, or $40,000. If the work in the above
example were <i>classified</i>, and the contractor were paid so much money
for each yard of rock and so much money for each yard of earth
excavated, and his bid read 80 cents for rock and 30 cents for earth,
it would be said to be a <i>balanced bid</i>. Other contractors, seeing his
bid, would know that he considered that he could do the rock work at
a profit at 80 cents, and earthwork at a profit at 30 cents. In
order to prevent them from obtaining this information, the contractor
can <i>unbalance</i> his bid, as it is termed; and in this event he
would bid perhaps as follows&mdash;namely, 100,000 yards of earth at 40
cents, or $40,000; and 50,000 yards of rock at 60 cents, or $30,000.
The total amount of this contract would be the same, and he
would make the same profit; but his competitors would be deceived
as to his basis of doing work.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of this from the contractor's point of view is
that, in the event of an error having been made in an estimate of
quantity, he might find himself doing less than 100,000 yards of earth
and more than 50,000 yards of rock, in which event he would stand
to lose money.</p>

<p><b>Material Supply.</b> In concrete work particularly, it is all-important
that material&mdash;cement, sand, and stone&mdash;be promptly shipped,
and at the same time not too promptly shipped. If the shipments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
are not promptly made, there will be a failure of material to arrive,
which will throw the men out of work, with all that this implies in high
costs. If the material is shipped too rapidly, it will be necessary either
to unload it into a stock pile, which will involve the re-handling of the
material; or to pay demurrage charges to the railroad company, if
the shipments are made by rail.</p>

<p>In such work, at a time when there is likely to be any freight congestion
in the country, stock-pile facilities should be provided to care
for a supply of material to carry the work for one to two weeks.</p>

<p>On a piece of work involving, say, two large concrete mixers capable
of mixing 300 yards of material each per day, there will be used
900 yards of stone and sand per day, which, on a ten-day basis, will
mean a very respectable stock pile. This 9,000 yards of material,
costing perhaps one dollar per yard, means an investment of $9,000 in
stock pile, on which interest must be paid at the rate of, say, 6 per cent,
or $2.00 per working day, which means a trivial item compared with the
advantages derived from having a constant supply of material. The
total cost of this stock pile, in addition to interest, is the cost of
one re-handling of material out of the stock pile, which at 5 cents per
yard would be $450. This amount is very much less than the damage
that would accrue from not having any stock pile at all. On most
concrete jobs, there is usually provided a large storehouse for cement;
and when the work has to go over from one working season to another,
it is frequently the custom to leave the cement in storage. This is
frequently a cause of loss of money, because the cement, being hygroscopic,
absorbs moisture from the atmosphere, and is liable to spoil in
consequence. This can be avoided by keeping the storehouse dry
and warm through the winter, but this again is an expensive matter.</p>

<p><b>Old versus New Machinery.</b> In planning construction work, the
question always comes up as to whether to use old or new machinery.
No hard and fast rule can be prescribed. A case occurred upon an
important contract where there were needed some new boiler tubes
for the boiler that ran the main supply pump. The purchasing agent
of the contracting company, who happened also to be the President
and Chief Engineer of the company, bought some second-hand boiler
tubes, which were forthwith put into this boiler. The saving on the
boiler tubes was probably $8 or $10. The loss caused by a breakdown
of the same boiler was nearly $50. In purchasing second-hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
material, if the material can be thoroughly and rigidly inspected, it
is perhaps wise to purchase it, and sometimes money can be saved;
but as a general proposition, no second-hand material should be
purchased for a contract, unless it is done with the determination of
putting this material in first-class condition before it is used. The
best inspection, as a general thing, will not disclose the exact condition
of old material. By this it is not meant to intimate that new
material should be purchased for every new contract.</p>

<p><b>Use of Maps.</b> A precaution on construction work that is very
seldom taken by contractors generally, and one that is a most certain
saver of money, is to have a complete map of the work to a large scale
carefully prepared, on which should be indicated day by day the progress
of the work. This map, if kept up to date, will enable the
manager of a company, or the president and directors, to know in
detail the progress of the work, without necessarily going out on the
work; and from it can be found the quantities of needed materials,
such as rail, pipe, etc.</p>

<p><b>Standard Instructions.</b> Every organization doing field work
would do well to follow the custom admirably illustrated by Frank B.
Gilbreth, of issuing regular standard instructions to foremen and to
employees generally. These instructions have been published in
book form by the Myron C. Clark Publishing Company, and are an
admirable example of the type. The idea follows that of the old
Railroad Company's "Book of Rules" that will tend toward evading
similar accidents in the future. In this manner eventually a contractor
can obtain a control of his organization, and a freedom from
accidents, that will be extremely valuable.</p>

<p><b>Chronological Charts.</b> These are intended to show the proposed
time of completion in certain parts of the work. A valuable aid
to a manager on work requiring a large amount of material, and where
there is a small amount of available space, is a chart showing the time
and quantity of expected materials and supplies. This will enable
him to see at a glance where he may expect to be in the matter of his
materials, and will tend to relieve his mind of one of its most annoying
problems. These same charts can also show him the estimated times
of completion of certain parts of the work.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct gesperrt">ON THE SUBJECT OF</p>

<p class="pc1">GENERAL EXPENSE AND COST SUMMARIES</p>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p>1. Explain the relationship between expense and cost of
production and why the former should be absorbed by the latter.</p>

<p>2. Why is manufacturing expense related to cost rather than
selling price?</p>

<p>3. Why is the labor cost of production considered the most
reliable basis for calculating expense?</p>

<p>4. What is a safe rule to follow in the segregation of pay-roll
into productive and non-productive labor?</p>

<p>5. Why is expense not added to operating costs?</p>

<p>6. For a factory with, say, twelve departments or processes,
some without any machinery, some with machinery in operation all the
time, and others where it is running but part of the time, what means
for handling the factory expense would you recommend and why?</p>

<p>7. What do you consider the value of machine rates and where
can they be used to advantage?</p>

<p>8. When selling expense is not included in the general expense
distribution, how is rate of same arrived at and the selling cost found?</p>

<p>9. Wherein would be the error to carry all the factory operating
and general expense in one account and distribute both by one average
rate for the entire plant?</p>

<p>10. The trial balance shows a debit balance for <i>operating
expense</i> Dept. F and a credit balance for Dept. G. What do these
balances mean? How should they appear on the balance sheet?</p>

<p>11. The debit balance of <i>operating expense</i> Dept. F, at the end
of the month, is $100; at the end of the next month it is $200. What
does this increase signify and what should be done?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>12. The credit balance of <i>operating expense</i> Dept. G at the end
of the month is $100; at the end of the next month it is $200. What
should be done in this case?</p>

<p>13. The trial balance shows but one item of general expense&mdash;the
<i>distribution account</i>. How would you proceed to analyze the
various subdivisions of <i>general expense</i>?</p>

<p>14. Is a department operated at 50% of its productive labor
necessarily operated with any less efficiency than another where the
expense is but 25%. Why?</p>

<p>15. The operating statement shows increasing percentages
each month. What does this condition of affairs reveal and what
two ways are at once suggested for improving the situation?</p>

<p>16. A foreman, to have the operating expense of his department
show more favorably, diverts his expense charges onto other work.
How can such irregularities generally be detected?</p>

<p>17. A workman's wage is 30 cents per hour in a department
whose operating expense is 40% of its productive labor and whose
general expense is 33⅓%. How much per hour should the company
charge for this man's services on a repair job in order to make a profit
of 20%?</p>

<p>18. Calculate the departmental and general expense percentage
rates for distribution in a factory whose operating figures are shown
as follows:</p>
